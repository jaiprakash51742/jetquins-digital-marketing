				<![CDATA[<p>With the Internet transforming the way people digest and consume information, it is no surprise that social media marketing is an industry in itself. This phenomenon has gained fast ground in the last couple of decades with the rise of more visual and engaging mediums like Snapchat and Instagram. Forget billboards and newspaper ad space, social marketing is such a burgeoning monster that even Facebook and Twitter are often viewed as stale goods, channels used to market products only when both the company CEO and budget have their arms wide open and pockets running deep. Under the microscope: Tanishq Tanishq had once launched a month-long digital campaign, “Confessions of a Bride” , where brides-to-be could log on to the company website and confess their secret desires-their idea of the perfect dream wedding. Lucky winners with the most unique and interesting confessions would get the chance to live and experience the dream. Created by Interactive Avenues, one of the leading Digital Marketing Agencies in India, the idea was to celebrate the evolved, modern Indian bride. The independent, opinionated individual who is often too busy with work and wants to marry the man of her choice, her way. What made this is a successful and innovative campaign is the fact that not only not did it keep with the times, but that Digital Marketing Agencies in India today manage to capture the sheer essence of the brand. In this case, Interactive Avenues  picked up on themes like  ‘independence with elegance’ and the ‘the spirit of womanhood’, and marketed  it so artfully, that viewers did not perceive the campaigns as a publicity gimmick, but rather as thoughtfully-crafted films that talked to the them. Fresh, fun and wistfully beautiful, “Confessions of a Bride” proved to be a trendsetter, garnering upto 1 M views and reinforcing the encouraging, evolving and traditionally progressive image of Tanishq in the minds of viewers. Social media marketing is a powerful way for businesses to catch attention and gain traffic by making use of social media platforms and websites to promote products and services. Digital marketing agencies often use Youtube to launch time-stipulated campaigns that often touch upon socially relevant issues like women empowerment, safe sex, teenage suicide and so on. One of the most recent examples is Manforce Condoms’ new campaign, “ShutThePhoneUp” targeted at young couples that discusses safe sex, filming of intimate moments and pornography. When we talk of social marketing, Digital Marketing Companies in Patna and Mumbai, urban, youth-driven cities, seem to be producing the best results. Take FoxyMoron’s Bournville campaign of 2011 for example.

				<![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the Internet transforming the way people digest and consume information, it is no surprise that social media marketing is an industry in itself. This phenomenon has gained fast ground in the last couple of decades with the rise of more visual and engaging mediums like Snapchat and Instagram.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Forget billboards and newspaper ad space, social marketing is such a burgeoning monster that even Facebook and Twitter are often viewed as stale goods, channels used to market products only when both the company CEO and budget have their arms wide open and pockets running deep.</span></p>
<p><span id="more-104"></span></p>
<h4><strong>Under the microscope: Tanishq</strong></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tanishq had once launched a month-long digital campaign, “Confessions of a Bride” , where brides-to-be could log on to the company website and confess their secret desires-their idea of the perfect dream wedding. Lucky winners with the most unique and interesting confessions would get the chance to live and experience the dream.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Created by </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Interactive Avenues</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, one of the leading </span><a href="https://www.jetquins travelsagency.com/"><b>Digital Marketing Agencies</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in India, the idea was to celebrate the evolved, modern Indian bride. The independent, opinionated individual who is often too busy with work and wants to marry the man of her choice, her way. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What made this is a successful and innovative campaign is the fact that not only not did it keep with the times, but that </span><a href="https://www.jetquins travelsagency.com/"><b>Digital Marketing Agencies</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in India today manage to capture the sheer essence of the brand. In this case, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Interactive Avenues </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> picked up on themes like  ‘independence with elegance’ and the ‘the spirit of womanhood’, and marketed  it so artfully, that viewers did not perceive the campaigns as a publicity gimmick, but rather as thoughtfully-crafted films that talked to the them. Fresh, fun and wistfully beautiful, “Confessions of a Bride” proved to be a trendsetter, garnering upto 1 M views and reinforcing the encouraging, evolving and traditionally progressive image of Tanishq in the minds of viewers.</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Social media marketing is a powerful way for businesses to catch attention and gain traffic by making use of social media platforms and websites to promote products and services.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Digital marketing agencies often use Youtube to launch time-stipulated campaigns that often touch upon socially relevant issues like women empowerment, safe sex, teenage suicide and so on.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the most recent examples is Manforce Condoms’ new campaign, “ShutThePhoneUp” targeted at young couples that discusses safe sex, filming of intimate moments and pornography.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When we talk of social marketing, </span><a href="https://www.jetquins travelsagency.com/"><b>Digital Marketing Companies in Patna</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and Mumbai, urban, youth-driven cities, seem to be producing the best results. Take FoxyMoron’s Bournville campaign of 2011 for example. An interactive content piece titled ‘Dark Secrets of a Chocolatier; which featured a series of dark chocolate recipes using Bournville, the video garnered a sizeable number of views and even led to tie-ups with the like of Sulafest and The Comedy Club.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the leading </span><a href="https://www.jetquins travelsagency.com/"><b>Digital Marketing Companies in Patna</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as well as India, FoxyMoron managed to earn a</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">n organic Rank 6 for the keyword ‘Dark Chocolate’ on Google Search securing the fate of Cadbury forever.</span></p>

From startups to established enterprises, a solid digital approach is now essential to stay competitive and grow in today&#8217;s fast-paced digital landscape. Here&#8217;s why a digital marketing strategy is crucial in 2024: 1. Stay Relevant in a Digital-First World In 2024, digital marketing is no longer optional; it’s essential. With more people spending time online than ever before, businesses that neglect their digital presence risk becoming irrelevant. A well-crafted strategy ensures your brand is visible and resonates with your audience in a world that operates primarily online. 2.

With billions of users across platforms like Instagram, Facebook, LinkedIn, and TikTok, a strong social media presence connects you to your target audience more directly than ever before. Digital marketing strategies tap into this power, helping you shape perceptions, build trust, and foster loyalty. 4. Cost-Effective Marketing for Startups For startups and small businesses, digital marketing is a cost-effective way to compete with larger, established companies. You can target niche audiences, track performance in real-time, and adjust strategies without the high costs associated with traditional marketing. It&#8217;s a smart way to establish a brand presence and generate leads early on. 5. Improve Customer Experience Through Real-Time Feedback Digital platforms enable businesses to engage with customers quickly and efficiently. Whether addressing complaints, gathering feedback, or offering support, a digital marketing strategy improves customer service and satisfaction.

Optimize Your Performance with Data One of the key advantages of digital marketing is the ability to track and measure performance in real-time. Using analytics tools, you can assess which campaigns are working, where improvements can be made, and how to optimize ROI. This data-driven approach ensures that marketing efforts are constantly refined for maximum effectiveness. 7. Align Your Business Goals and Customer Needs A comprehensive digital marketing strategy aligns your business objectives with the needs of your customers. By clearly defining your goals, you can create campaigns that resonate with your audience at multiple touchpoints, fostering long-term engagement and trust. 8.

By analyzing patterns in online interactions, purchases, and preferences, you can tailor your offerings to meet specific demands. This proactive approach puts you ahead of competitors by addressing your audience&#8217;s needs before they even know they have them. 10. Integrate Digital and Traditional Marketing for Maximum Impact An integrated approach that combines digital marketing with traditional methods can amplify your results. Whether through print, TV, or radio, blending digital strategies like content marketing and social media with traditional outlets allows you to engage a broader audience and create a consistent brand narrative.

				<![CDATA[<p>My own experiences and witnessed facts made me to write this conclusions. 1) Works initially: Onset launch of the agency, and expectations of success we beat our heart and say our agency is an all rounder but trust the fact that most of the deals come in one side, they work the way they want us to be so, stay unique in one thing initially where you can prove, excel and become a brand in that arena. 2) Playing with numbers is an strategy: Have a detailed idea about cost, expenses and shortages. Pricing the deals was the primary thing in the pyramid to pamper. Here in digital marketing bargaining customers for an expected pricing deals is really tougher job, but still getting some data about around agency formulas and limitations you can make a strategy. 3) Hiring is Mining: In digital marketing you see people from different fields coming here. So, while hiring checking the basic skills and adaptability are shortlisted as bullets. And training them is like loading them. And get some highly skilled professionals to watch dog all this mining step of hiring and to run the projects well. 4) Sales as Soul: What, where, when and why doesn&#8217;t matter all that matter is your sales trails. Train every person in your agency – How to explain the company to others, how contacts and relations work in getting a sale. And tell them how to connect the sale to the agency. Motivate and train them like wolf of your street. Because sales is the plug point of everything to your agency. Have sales mindset in dealing with every fishy thing. 5) Hunt your opportunities: Never skip a meet, conference, presentations, summit, and which ever it is where you meet new people and have a chance to introduce your company to others. Because, no person knows from where the exact deal takes place. Become, Bruce Lee in opportunities by understanding the situation you make the deal happen like water.                   6) Promote and Brand yourself: Brand yourself as the best monkey in the pool of the field you work. Whenever chance comes explain something where they get information and even believe you have a grip on the field. Prove and make them believe you as an addict to the field you work. So, it all starts remembering you, suggesting you to others, counter meeting. Just make it happen because people believe in usage, but finally opt a brand in it.

				<![CDATA[<p>Ever find yourself in a cycle of worry, stress and anxiety about your own business? That kind of self-doubt is far too common. I know this is true, because probably 90% of the entrepreneurs I talk to feel stuck (or like they&#8217;re not moving fast enough). This is particularly true for service-professionals like creatives, consultants, freelancers, etc. when they start thinking about shifting from “one to one” to “one to many” programs and offerings. Even though most of folks who bill clients by the hour hate trading dollars for hours, and even though they know they want to shift to more scalable offerings, so often I see them struggling to make the jump… the truth is, the only thing hold them back … is themselves. My friend John Corcoran says it’s possible to attract a big influx of clients quickly &#8211; in fact, you could attract 10 new clients in 30 days or less. And he says this can be done by business owners from professional services backgrounds, like consultants, marketers, designers, coaches, financial advisors, and writers/speakers. Even if you feel like you don’t have the time or technical skills. John is an interesting guy… he was a Writer in the Clinton White House, has written for Forbes and Entrepreneur, and after years of running his own boutique law firm, he ditched trading “hours for dollars” to create more scaleable, “one to many” group programs and offerings. We also provide seo services in patna. This week, I am hosting a free workshop where John will share his strategies and tactics for how you can attract 10 new clients to your business (in just 30 days). And John will share how you can do it with existing relationships you already have, without setting up complicated sales funnels or software or spending thousands on risky ad campaigns.

				<![CDATA[<p>Hey, I&#8217;ll just come right out and say it: &#8220;Great content&#8221; is NOT all it&#8217;s cracked up to be. You may think that I&#8217;m crazy for saying that&#8230; But, as they say, numbers don&#8217;t lie. My unconventional approach to SEO quickly catapulted Backlinko from a blank WordPress installation to 180k monthly visitors. (Not to mention 100k email subscribers and a 7-figure business) But I didn&#8217;t email you today to brag. I&#8217;m here to show you that there&#8217;s a better way to do SEO and content marketing&#8230;. &#8230;an approach that gets consistent results for you and your business. Before I outline my approach, let me tell you a quick story: Back when I did SEO client work, I had a client in the precious metal investment space. This client sold extremely expensive gold and silver bullion bars (the same ones they have at Fort Knox). As you might imagine, this industry is VERY competitive. In fact, the average sale is around 25k. And my approach for this client was dead simple: &#8220;Publish great content on a regular basis.&#8221; And that&#8217;s exactly what I did: I published a new piece of quality content on his blog every week&#8230;like clockwork. So&#8230;what happened? To put it in simple terms, nothing. After four months of publishing on a regular basis, my client&#8217;s organic search engine traffic barely budged. So I decided to switch things up. Instead of blindly following a publishing schedule, I focused on pushing out AMAZING content. Specifically, content that was built to maximize shares, traffic, and first page rankings. (I also spent a ton of time promoting the content I created) Then something crazy happened: Using this new approach, I created an infographic for this client&#8230; &#8230;and that infographic went viral. My client&#8217;s infographic was featured on huge investment sites (like ZeroHedge) and mainstream news sites (like The Christian Post). So we quickly created ANOTHER infographic using the same system. And that infographic went viral too. Even more than the first one. Needless to say, my client was head over heels pumped. And I learned a lesson from that experience that I&#8217;ll never forget: Most people believe the secret to first page rankings and targeted traffic is to publish &#8220;great content&#8221;. Instead, first page rankings are a direct result of strategically promoting your content the right way. And that&#8217;s the unconventional approach to SEO I talked about in my new ebook. Speaking of the ebook, I also revealed the 7 Deadly SEO Mistakes that hold people back from the first page rankings they deserve. In my experience, overcoming these mistakes is KEY if you want to get more traffic, leads, and customers from your content. Also: I’m going to send you an all new case study later this week. In that case study I’ll show you how I created a piece of content that ranks in the top 5 for the keyword “link building”. I’ll walk you through the entire process, step-by-step. But for now, check out the ebook. And I’ll see you later this week. About our Company: Jetquins Travels is one of those unique digital marketing companies in Patna which blends creativity with feasibility. We offer a plethora of services like SEO, SEM, SMM, Complete Digital Marketing, Website Design and Development, Domain Registration, Web Hosting, E – Commerce Solutions, Content Management System and other IT related projects.

				<![CDATA[<p>Hey, Here’s the truth: When I first launched Backlinko, the odds were stacked against me. I was entering the insanely competitive digital marketing space&#8230; &#8230;and I had a grand total of FIVE Twitter followers. I quickly realized that I couldn&#8217;t copy the same content strategy that my big brand competitors were using. If I did, I&#8217;d be squashed like a bug. So I did the opposite. Soon after launching Backlinko, I created a guide that quickly generated over 9 thousand unique visitors. And that single post has racked up 275,670 visitors to date (my post also ranks in the top 5 for the keyword, “link building”). As you’ll see in the video, I created this piece of content using a strategy called “The Go-To Guidebook”. And the funny thing about The Go-To Guidebook is that it&#8217;s REALLY easy to put together. Just follow the steps, fill in the blanks, and you’re set. So even if you’re a one man show competing against big brands, The Go-To Guidebook can help you. (After all, it’s exactly what I used to outrank Search Engine Land, Entrepreneur and other authority sites) Obviously, content promotion played a role in my success. But here’s the deal: Content promotion only works if you have something worth promoting. You can send the perfect outreach email at the perfect time&#8230; &#8230;But if your content isn’t up to snuff, it won’t get shared or linked to. Fortunately, when you create content like my Go-To Guidebook, you have something highly-shareable on your hands. That’s because The Go-To Guidebook has content promotion baked right into it. Below the video there’s a PDF worksheet for you to download. The worksheet won’t make sense unless you watch the video. But it WILL help you execute the new strategy that I outline. So I recommend that you download it after you finish watching the video.

<div>Hey,</div>
<div>
<p>Here’s the truth:</p>
<p>When I first launched Backlinko, the odds were stacked against me.</p>
<p>I was entering the insanely competitive digital marketing space&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8230;and I had a grand total of FIVE Twitter followers.</p>
<p>I quickly realized that I couldn&#8217;t copy the same content strategy that my big brand competitors were using. If I did, I&#8217;d be squashed like a bug.</p>
<p><strong>So I did the opposite.</strong></p>
<p>Soon after launching Backlinko, I created a guide that quickly generated over 9 thousand unique visitors.</p>
<p>And that single post has racked up 275,670 visitors to date (my post also ranks in the top 5 for the keyword, “link building”).</p>
<p>As you’ll see in the video, I created this piece of content using a strategy called “The Go-To Guidebook”.</p>
<p>And the funny thing about The Go-To Guidebook is that it&#8217;s REALLY easy to put together.</p>
<p>Just follow the steps, fill in the blanks, and you’re set.</p>
<p>So even if you’re a one man show competing against big brands, The Go-To Guidebook can help you.</p>
<p>(After all, it’s exactly what I used to outrank Search Engine Land, Entrepreneur and other authority sites)</p>
<p>Obviously, content promotion played a role in my success.</p>
<p><strong>But here’s the deal:</strong></p>
<p>Content promotion only works if you have something worth promoting.</p>
<p>You can send the perfect outreach email at the perfect time&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8230;But if your content isn’t up to snuff, it won’t get shared or linked to.</p>
<p>Fortunately, when you create content like my Go-To Guidebook, you have something highly-shareable on your hands.</p>
<p>That’s because The Go-To Guidebook has content promotion baked right into it.</p>
<p>Below the video there’s a PDF worksheet for you to download.</p>
<p>The worksheet won’t make sense unless you watch the video. But it WILL help you execute the new strategy that I outline.</p>
<p>So I recommend that you download it after you finish watching the video.</p>

				<![CDATA[<p>Hey, When I was about to launch my first blog in 2010, I felt GREAT. To prepare for the big launch, I poured over dozens of SEO blog posts and forum threads. So I was super excited when my blog finally went live. I thought to myself: &#8220;It’s only a matter of time before you hit Google’s first page.” There was only one problem: It never happened. Flash forward to today and Backlinko brings in over 180k unique visitors per month. What changed? I started to use the Do The Opposite Framework. And it’s a framework more people are using to generate higher rankings and targeted traffic. For example, here are 3 “normal” folks that are using the Do The Opposite Framework to grow their online business: &#8211; Dave Peralta recently hit Google’s first page for his target keyword. &#8211; Aaron Johnson created a blog post that outranks Wikipedia and Trip Advisor &#8211; Darren Dematas quickly boosted his ecommerce site’s traffic by 259% As you’ll see in the article, these 3 marketers didn&#8217;t have huge marketing budgets or connections with influential bloggers. In fact, like many people, they wrestled with common SEO challenges like: “I’m already doing well with SEO. Now I want to scale up. The thing is, I’m a one man army going against big sites. Can I really scale if I’m doing it all myself?” “I know how to write great content. But need to get better at promoting it.” “I run an ecommerce site. Will white hat SEO really work for me?” &#8220;I have clients in boring niches. Can I really create something people will actually share?” If any of these statements sound familiar to you, you’re far from alone. And I show you how to overcome these obstacles in today’s article.
