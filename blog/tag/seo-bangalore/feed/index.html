				<![CDATA[<p>What is SEO? SEO stands for (Search Engine Optimization). It is basically the process of affecting the online visibility of a website or webpage in a web search engine’s unpaid results and getting traffic from the “free”, “organic”, “natural” or “earned” search results on search engines. Generally, the earlier and more frequently a website appears in the search results list the more clicks it will get from the search engine’s users. It may target different kinds of searches, including image search and video search. What is CONTENT MARKETING? Content Marketing, on the other hand, is a marketing technique which involves creating pages on your site having content that the general audience will find interesting and get attracted with the objective of driving profitable customer action. It may be blogs, posts, articles, guides, info graphics, videos and more. It helps in building a strong relationship with your target audience, by providing them with high quality content which is very relevant to them on a consistent basis. LINK BETWEEN SEO &#38; CONTENT MARKETING There’s a slight confusion over SEO and Content Marketing.  People think that SEO and Content Marketing is the same. But it is not. And the primary reason for this confusion is that there’s a decent amount of overlap between the two. But instead SEO and Content Marketing both go hand in hand and have a mutual relationship. Another way to look at this situation is to think like SEO makes demands while content marketing fulfils those demands. SEO demands content while Content marketing is content. You are not an SEO until you are also a content marketer and vice-versa. Similarly your SEO campaign will fail until you integrate content marketing and vice-versa.
