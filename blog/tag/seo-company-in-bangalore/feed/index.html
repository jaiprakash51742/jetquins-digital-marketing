				<![CDATA[<p>What is SEO? SEO stands for (Search Engine Optimization). It is basically the process of affecting the online visibility of a website or webpage in a web search engine’s unpaid results and getting traffic from the “free”, “organic”, “natural” or “earned” search results on search engines. Generally, the earlier and more frequently a website appears in the search results list the more clicks it will get from the search engine’s users. It may target different kinds of searches, including image search and video search. What is CONTENT MARKETING? Content Marketing, on the other hand, is a marketing technique which involves creating pages on your site having content that the general audience will find interesting and get attracted with the objective of driving profitable customer action. It may be blogs, posts, articles, guides, info graphics, videos and more. It helps in building a strong relationship with your target audience, by providing them with high quality content which is very relevant to them on a consistent basis. LINK BETWEEN SEO &#38; CONTENT MARKETING There’s a slight confusion over SEO and Content Marketing.  People think that SEO and Content Marketing is the same. But it is not. And the primary reason for this confusion is that there’s a decent amount of overlap between the two. But instead SEO and Content Marketing both go hand in hand and have a mutual relationship. Another way to look at this situation is to think like SEO makes demands while content marketing fulfils those demands. SEO demands content while Content marketing is content. You are not an SEO until you are also a content marketer and vice-versa. Similarly your SEO campaign will fail until you integrate content marketing and vice-versa. SEO and Content Marketing should work together as just from these basic points it is visible that SEO and Content Marketing are separate concepts that go hand-in-hand. But despite their differences, they can’t function without each other. Jetquins Travels is one of the best seo companies in patna which provides top SEO services in Patna.

				<![CDATA[<p>My own experiences and witnessed facts made me to write this conclusions. 1) Works initially: Onset launch of the agency, and expectations of success we beat our heart and say our agency is an all rounder but trust the fact that most of the deals come in one side, they work the way they want us to be so, stay unique in one thing initially where you can prove, excel and become a brand in that arena. 2) Playing with numbers is an strategy: Have a detailed idea about cost, expenses and shortages. Pricing the deals was the primary thing in the pyramid to pamper. Here in digital marketing bargaining customers for an expected pricing deals is really tougher job, but still getting some data about around agency formulas and limitations you can make a strategy. 3) Hiring is Mining: In digital marketing you see people from different fields coming here. So, while hiring checking the basic skills and adaptability are shortlisted as bullets. And training them is like loading them. And get some highly skilled professionals to watch dog all this mining step of hiring and to run the projects well. 4) Sales as Soul: What, where, when and why doesn&#8217;t matter all that matter is your sales trails. Train every person in your agency – How to explain the company to others, how contacts and relations work in getting a sale. And tell them how to connect the sale to the agency. Motivate and train them like wolf of your street. Because sales is the plug point of everything to your agency. Have sales mindset in dealing with every fishy thing. 5) Hunt your opportunities: Never skip a meet, conference, presentations, summit, and which ever it is where you meet new people and have a chance to introduce your company to others. Because, no person knows from where the exact deal takes place. Become, Bruce Lee in opportunities by understanding the situation you make the deal happen like water.                   6) Promote and Brand yourself: Brand yourself as the best monkey in the pool of the field you work. Whenever chance comes explain something where they get information and even believe you have a grip on the field. Prove and make them believe you as an addict to the field you work. So, it all starts remembering you, suggesting you to others, counter meeting. Just make it happen because people believe in usage, but finally opt a brand in it.

				<![CDATA[<p>Ever find yourself in a cycle of worry, stress and anxiety about your own business? That kind of self-doubt is far too common. I know this is true, because probably 90% of the entrepreneurs I talk to feel stuck (or like they&#8217;re not moving fast enough). This is particularly true for service-professionals like creatives, consultants, freelancers, etc. when they start thinking about shifting from “one to one” to “one to many” programs and offerings. Even though most of folks who bill clients by the hour hate trading dollars for hours, and even though they know they want to shift to more scalable offerings, so often I see them struggling to make the jump… the truth is, the only thing hold them back … is themselves. My friend John Corcoran says it’s possible to attract a big influx of clients quickly &#8211; in fact, you could attract 10 new clients in 30 days or less. And he says this can be done by business owners from professional services backgrounds, like consultants, marketers, designers, coaches, financial advisors, and writers/speakers. Even if you feel like you don’t have the time or technical skills. John is an interesting guy… he was a Writer in the Clinton White House, has written for Forbes and Entrepreneur, and after years of running his own boutique law firm, he ditched trading “hours for dollars” to create more scaleable, “one to many” group programs and offerings. We also provide seo services in patna. This week, I am hosting a free workshop where John will share his strategies and tactics for how you can attract 10 new clients to your business (in just 30 days). And John will share how you can do it with existing relationships you already have, without setting up complicated sales funnels or software or spending thousands on risky ad campaigns.

				<![CDATA[<p>Hey, I&#8217;ll just come right out and say it: &#8220;Great content&#8221; is NOT all it&#8217;s cracked up to be. You may think that I&#8217;m crazy for saying that&#8230; But, as they say, numbers don&#8217;t lie. My unconventional approach to SEO quickly catapulted Backlinko from a blank WordPress installation to 180k monthly visitors. (Not to mention 100k email subscribers and a 7-figure business) But I didn&#8217;t email you today to brag. I&#8217;m here to show you that there&#8217;s a better way to do SEO and content marketing&#8230;. &#8230;an approach that gets consistent results for you and your business. Before I outline my approach, let me tell you a quick story: Back when I did SEO client work, I had a client in the precious metal investment space. This client sold extremely expensive gold and silver bullion bars (the same ones they have at Fort Knox). As you might imagine, this industry is VERY competitive. In fact, the average sale is around 25k. And my approach for this client was dead simple: &#8220;Publish great content on a regular basis.&#8221; And that&#8217;s exactly what I did: I published a new piece of quality content on his blog every week&#8230;like clockwork. So&#8230;what happened? To put it in simple terms, nothing. After four months of publishing on a regular basis, my client&#8217;s organic search engine traffic barely budged. So I decided to switch things up. Instead of blindly following a publishing schedule, I focused on pushing out AMAZING content. Specifically, content that was built to maximize shares, traffic, and first page rankings. (I also spent a ton of time promoting the content I created) Then something crazy happened: Using this new approach, I created an infographic for this client&#8230; &#8230;and that infographic went viral. My client&#8217;s infographic was featured on huge investment sites (like ZeroHedge) and mainstream news sites (like The Christian Post). So we quickly created ANOTHER infographic using the same system. And that infographic went viral too. Even more than the first one. Needless to say, my client was head over heels pumped. And I learned a lesson from that experience that I&#8217;ll never forget: Most people believe the secret to first page rankings and targeted traffic is to publish &#8220;great content&#8221;.

				<![CDATA[<p>Hey,</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll just come right out and say it:</p>
<p>&#8220;Great content&#8221; is NOT all it&#8217;s cracked up to be.</p>
<p>You may think that I&#8217;m crazy for saying that&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>But, as they say, numbers don&#8217;t lie.</strong></p>
<p>My unconventional approach to SEO quickly catapulted Backlinko from a blank WordPress installation to 180k monthly visitors.</p>
<p>(Not to mention 100k email subscribers and a 7-figure business)</p>
<p>But I didn&#8217;t email you today to brag.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m here to show you that there&#8217;s a better way to do SEO and content marketing&#8230;.</p>
<p>&#8230;an approach that gets consistent results for you and your business.</p>
<p><span id="more-31"></span></p>
<p><strong>Before I outline my approach, let me tell you a quick story:</strong></p>
<p>Back when I did SEO client work, I had a client in the precious metal investment space.</p>
<p>This client sold extremely expensive gold and silver bullion bars (the same ones they have at Fort Knox).</p>
<p>As you might imagine, this industry is VERY competitive. In fact, the average sale is around 25k.</p>
<p>And my approach for this client was dead simple:</p>
<p>&#8220;Publish great content on a regular basis.&#8221;</p>
<p>And that&#8217;s exactly what I did:</p>
<p>I published a new piece of quality content on his blog every week&#8230;like clockwork.</p>
<p>So&#8230;what happened?</p>
<p>To put it in simple terms, <strong>nothing.</strong></p>
<p>After four months of publishing on a regular basis, my client&#8217;s organic search engine traffic barely budged.</p>
<p>So I decided to switch things up.</p>
<p>Instead of blindly following a publishing schedule, I focused on pushing out AMAZING content.</p>
<p>Specifically, content that was built to maximize shares, traffic, and first page rankings.</p>
<p>(I also spent a ton of time promoting the content I created)</p>
<p><strong>Then something crazy happened:</strong></p>
<p>Using this new approach, I created an infographic for this client&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8230;and that infographic went viral.</p>
<p>My client&#8217;s infographic was featured on huge investment sites (like ZeroHedge) and mainstream news sites (like The Christian Post).</p>
<p>So we quickly created ANOTHER infographic using the same system.</p>
<p>And that infographic went viral too. Even more than the first one.</p>
<p>Needless to say, my client was head over heels pumped.</p>
<p><strong>And I learned a lesson from that experience that I&#8217;ll never forget:</strong></p>
<p>Most people believe the secret to first page rankings and targeted traffic is to publish &#8220;great content&#8221;.</p>
<p>Instead, first page rankings are a direct result of strategically promoting your content the right way.</p>
<p>And that&#8217;s the unconventional approach to SEO I talked about in my new ebook.</p>
<p>Speaking of the ebook, I also revealed the 7 Deadly SEO Mistakes that hold people back from the first page rankings they deserve.</p>
<p>In my experience, overcoming these mistakes is KEY if you want to get more traffic, leads, and customers from your content.</p>
<p>Also:</p>
<p>I’m going to send you an all new case study later this week.</p>
<p>In that case study I’ll show you how I created a piece of content that ranks in the top 5 for the keyword “link building”.</p>
<p>I’ll walk you through the entire process, step-by-step.</p>
<p>But for now, check out the ebook. And I’ll see you later this week.</p>

				<![CDATA[<p>Hey, Here’s the truth: When I first launched Backlinko, the odds were stacked against me. I was entering the insanely competitive digital marketing space&#8230; &#8230;and I had a grand total of FIVE Twitter followers. I quickly realized that I couldn&#8217;t copy the same content strategy that my big brand competitors were using. If I did, I&#8217;d be squashed like a bug. So I did the opposite. Soon after launching Backlinko, I created a guide that quickly generated over 9 thousand unique visitors. And that single post has racked up 275,670 visitors to date (my post also ranks in the top 5 for the keyword, “link building”). As you’ll see in the video, I created this piece of content using a strategy called “The Go-To Guidebook”. And the funny thing about The Go-To Guidebook is that it&#8217;s REALLY easy to put together. Just follow the steps, fill in the blanks, and you’re set. So even if you’re a one man show competing against big brands, The Go-To Guidebook can help you. (After all, it’s exactly what I used to outrank Search Engine Land, Entrepreneur and other authority sites) Obviously, content promotion played a role in my success. But here’s the deal: Content promotion only works if you have something worth promoting. You can send the perfect outreach email at the perfect time&#8230; &#8230;But if your content isn’t up to snuff, it won’t get shared or linked to. Fortunately, when you create content like my Go-To Guidebook, you have something highly-shareable on your hands. That’s because The Go-To Guidebook has content promotion baked right into it. Below the video there’s a PDF worksheet for you to download. The worksheet won’t make sense unless you watch the video. But it WILL help you execute the new strategy that I outline. So I recommend that you download it after you finish watching the video.

				<![CDATA[<p>Hey, When I was about to launch my first blog in 2010, I felt GREAT. To prepare for the big launch, I poured over dozens of SEO blog posts and forum threads. So I was super excited when my blog finally went live. I thought to myself: &#8220;It’s only a matter of time before you hit Google’s first page.” There was only one problem: It never happened. Flash forward to today and Backlinko brings in over 180k unique visitors per month. What changed? I started to use the Do The Opposite Framework. And it’s a framework more people are using to generate higher rankings and targeted traffic. For example, here are 3 “normal” folks that are using the Do The Opposite Framework to grow their online business: &#8211; Dave Peralta recently hit Google’s first page for his target keyword. &#8211; Aaron Johnson created a blog post that outranks Wikipedia and Trip Advisor &#8211; Darren Dematas quickly boosted his ecommerce site’s traffic by 259% As you’ll see in the article, these 3 marketers didn&#8217;t have huge marketing budgets or connections with influential bloggers. In fact, like many people, they wrestled with common SEO challenges like: “I’m already doing well with SEO. Now I want to scale up. The thing is, I’m a one man army going against big sites. Can I really scale if I’m doing it all myself?” “I know how to write great content. But need to get better at promoting it.” “I run an ecommerce site. Will white hat SEO really work for me?” &#8220;I have clients in boring niches. Can I really create something people will actually share?” If any of these statements sound familiar to you, you’re far from alone. And I show you how to overcome these obstacles in today’s article.

				<![CDATA[<p>Hey, Back in October 2013 I had it all figured out. (Or so I thought&#8230;) I had just launched my first website out of my parents&#8217; basement in Rhode Island. And I had everything ready to rock on launch day. Domain name and hosting? Check. Split testing software? Check. Product and sales funnel? Check. I was only missing one little thing: TRAFFIC Because I lacked targeted traffic, my site went absolutely nowhere. Unfortunately, it took me another 4 years to figure out how to get traffic from white hat SEO. Today, I&#8217;m happy to say that I&#8217;ve cracked the SEO traffic code. Would I like to get more traffic? Of course. (Doesn&#8217;t everybody?) But with 119k unique visitors/month, traffic isn’t a problem that keeps me up at night: Backlinko Google Analytics And looking back to my 4-year struggle, I can clearly see why SEO was an uphill battle for so long&#8230; First, I listened to the wrong people. I bought into the whole &#8220;just publish great content and you&#8217;ll rank&#8221; crowd. That idea may sound nice in a blog post, but it doesn&#8217;t work in the real world. I learned the hard way that if you want to get traffic from SEO, you need to hustle and promote your content. Second, I lacked a plan. This is HUGE. Unless you follow a proven, step-by-step blueprint, you&#8217;re going to struggle with SEO and content marketing. Period. From 2008 to 2012, I went from blog post to article to forum thread&#8230; &#8230;hoping that I&#8217;d magically put the pieces together. It didn&#8217;t happen. That&#8217;s when I decided to test everything myself to see what really worked. And that investment has paid off handsomely for me. Now that I have a plan, I don’t need to listen to randoms on forums. I just follow the steps. Get traffic. Rinse and repeat. And because I attract people that want to invest in my training products, I’ve quickly turned Backlinko from a blank WordPress installation into a 7-figure business. Bottom line? Whether you own an ecommerce site, run a digital marketing agency, sell a service, or are a full-time blogger, you NEED targeted traffic. In other words, traffic that converts into leads and sales. The best way to do that? Rank for keywords that your customers search for every day. And that’s exactly why I’m emailing you today. I&#8217;ve been working hard on a brand new project&#8230; &#8230;a project that I KNOW you&#8217;ll get a ton of value from. What&#8217;s the new project? It&#8217;s a new training series that will show you how to generate more buyer traffic for you and your business. I should warn you: This isn&#8217;t going to be the same cookie-cutter advice that you hear from so-called SEO &#8220;experts&#8221;. In fact, I fully expect my material to ruffle some feathers. So, you might be wondering: What will you learn over the next few weeks? Starting this coming Monday (October 31st), I&#8217;ll reveal the secret to creating content that generates first page rankings, targeted traffic, and sales. Specifically, you&#8217;ll learn: &#8211; How to create content that influencers in your industry WANT to share with their audience &#8211; The secret to content that ranks on the first page of Google for keywords that your customers search for every day (this is HUGE for turning content into sales) &#8211; The 4 deadly SEO mistakes that hold people back from success (hint: mistake #2 is something most so-called “experts” consider a &#8220;best practice&#8221;) &#8211; A NEW behind-the-scenes case study of how I created a single piece of content that&#8217;s generated 246,057 visitors and ranks in the top 3 in Google for a very competitive keyword And then, in mid-November, I&#8217;ll open enrollment for my premium business training course, SEO That Works 2.0. SEO That Works is the proven system trusted by over 1,500 graduates that shows you how to get first page rankings, step-by-step. In short, you&#8217;re going to get a ton of actionable content from me over the next few weeks. Like I said, I&#8217;m going to send you the first piece of content this Monday (October 31st). Keep an eye out for it. But in the meantime, here&#8217;s something I&#8217;d like you to do right now: Leave a quick comment right here saying, &#8220;I&#8217;m in!&#8221;. Then share the biggest struggle you have with SEO. It only takes a sec. Just click the link and leave a quick comment right now. And next week I’ll send you part 1 of this new training series. See you then. About our Company: Jetquins Travels is one of those unique digital marketing companies in Patna which blends creativity with feasibility.

				<![CDATA[<p>Hey,<br />
Back in October 2013 I had it all figured out.</p>
<p>(Or so I thought&#8230;)</p>
<p>I had just launched my first website out of my parents&#8217; basement in Rhode Island.</p>
<p>And I had everything ready to rock on launch day.</p>
<p>Domain name and hosting? Check.</p>
<p>Split testing software? Check.</p>
<p>Product and sales funnel? Check.</p>
<p>I was only missing one little thing:</p>
<p><span id="more-19"></span></p>
<p><strong>TRAFFIC</strong></p>
<p>Because I lacked targeted traffic, my site went absolutely nowhere.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it took me another 4 years to figure out how to get traffic from white hat SEO.</p>
<p>Today, I&#8217;m happy to say that I&#8217;ve cracked the SEO traffic code.</p>
<p>Would I like to get more traffic? Of course.</p>
<p>(Doesn&#8217;t everybody?)</p>
<p>But with 119k unique visitors/month, traffic isn’t a problem that keeps me up at night:</p>
<p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="aligncenter" src="https://ci3.googleusercontent.com/proxy/Sxmf5uh_D-rSCjRZ2-8Coe5dW26YBBoVapXzFJXTDf0UXbcCBdlEYNXF9T2MPUDf4PQBGsjLwSYvFMMEg8ZKduBP5XSeWUXBD_zdvEIZ5Orhzxzsqqd6KJBMZXS2dDwB3PQqv6pX85G5Pw0PRIa96w0zfz5jqbQ=s0-d-e1-ft#https://hostedimages-cdn.aweber-static.com/Njg4NTQy/original/e5e33be0320b46fc9a50eb743cf395c3.png" alt="Backlinko Google Analytics web traffic" width="563" height="447" /></p>
<p>Backlinko Google Analytics<br />
And looking back to my 4-year struggle, I can clearly see why SEO was an uphill battle for so long&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>First, I listened to the wrong people.</strong></p>
<p>I bought into the whole &#8220;just publish great content and you&#8217;ll rank&#8221; crowd. That idea may sound nice in a blog post, but it doesn&#8217;t work in the real world.</p>
<p>I learned the hard way that if you want to get traffic from SEO, you need to hustle and promote your content.</p>
<p><strong>Second, I lacked a plan.</strong></p>
<p>This is HUGE.</p>
<p>Unless you follow a proven, step-by-step blueprint, you&#8217;re going to struggle with SEO and content marketing. Period.</p>
<p>From 2008 to 2012, I went from blog post to article to forum thread&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8230;hoping that I&#8217;d magically put the pieces together.</p>
<p>It didn&#8217;t happen.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s when I decided to test everything myself to see what really worked. And that investment has paid off handsomely for me.</p>
<p>Now that I have a plan, I don’t need to listen to randoms on forums.</p>
<p>I just follow the steps. Get traffic. Rinse and repeat.</p>
<p>And because I attract people that want to invest in my training products, I’ve quickly turned Backlinko from a blank WordPress installation into a 7-figure business.</p>
<p><strong>Bottom line?</strong></p>
<p>Whether you own an ecommerce site, run a digital marketing agency, sell a service, or are a full-time blogger, you NEED targeted traffic.</p>
<p>In other words, traffic that converts into leads and sales.</p>
<p>The best way to do that?</p>
<p><strong>Rank for keywords that your customers search for every day.</strong></p>
<p>And that’s exactly why I’m emailing you today.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been working hard on a brand new project&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8230;a project that I KNOW you&#8217;ll get a ton of value from.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s the new project?</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a new training series that will show you how to generate more buyer traffic for you and your business.</p>
<p>I should warn you:</p>
<p>This isn&#8217;t going to be the same cookie-cutter advice that you hear from so-called SEO &#8220;experts&#8221;. In fact, I fully expect my material to ruffle some feathers.</p>
<p>So, you might be wondering:</p>
<p><strong>What will you learn over the next few weeks?</strong></p>
<p>Starting this coming Monday (October 31st), I&#8217;ll reveal the secret to creating content that generates first page rankings, targeted traffic, and sales.</p>
<p><strong>Specifically, you&#8217;ll learn:</strong></p>
<p>&#8211; How to create content that influencers in your industry WANT to share with their audience</p>
<p>&#8211; The secret to content that ranks on the first page of Google for keywords that your customers search for every day (this is HUGE for turning content into sales)</p>
<p>&#8211; The 4 deadly SEO mistakes that hold people back from success (hint: mistake #2 is something most so-called “experts” consider a &#8220;best practice&#8221;)</p>
<p>&#8211; A NEW behind-the-scenes case study of how I created a single piece of content that&#8217;s generated 246,057 visitors and ranks in the top 3 in Google for a very competitive keyword</p>
<p>And then, in mid-November, I&#8217;ll open enrollment for my premium business training course, SEO That Works 2.0. SEO That Works is the proven system trusted by over 1,500 graduates that shows you how to get first page rankings, step-by-step.</p>
<p>In short, you&#8217;re going to get a ton of actionable content from me over the next few weeks.</p>
<p>Like I said, I&#8217;m going to send you the first piece of content this Monday (October 31st). Keep an eye out for it.</p>
<p>But in the meantime, here&#8217;s something I&#8217;d like you to do right now:</p>

<p>It only takes a sec. Just click the link and leave a quick comment right now.</p>

				<![CDATA[<p>There have been various sorts of discussions on what is the most important part of SEO. After doing hours of arguing, the answer is very simple “Content”. This is because search engines cannot see images or videos so one needs to provide detailed information of the website in a text form. Often individuals spent most of the time in designing the website so that they do not have to spend much time on the content part of it. The look of the website is an important aspect no doubt about it, but content is ultimately what will engage the reader and will keep their attention. Good content is the one which is well structured and is timely updated so that the customer is forced to visit the website/blog again to read the fresh content. Reasons for content marketing being important in SEO are: Keyword research- We need to find out what the target audience are talking about and are asking for. The business data should be put into use to understand what we should be writing about, what the users are looking for in the product even that information which is missing from the site. Once this is known, the whole content production problem is solved. For eg: When Oscars was being aired live on TV, the people who are getting updates from internet, they must be using keywords like Oscar live, Oscar update or Oscar 2017, therefore the websites or the bloggers to optimise content search should use such keywords so that their website or post is on top of the search result pages. Internal linking- The content for better optimisation can be internally linked to external blogs and sites providing more information to the users. Usually other articles of our own or external content that provides valid data or any other useful information about the topic is internally linked. For eg: There is a blog on Ariel Share the Load and to validate its research an external link has been provided to validate the research conducted on men and their thinking on how laundry is considered to be a woman’s job. Navigation- The entire user experience is created through navigation. The user should be able to navigate from one page to another very easily. When the content is well structured and short and is able to link internally then navigation becomes easier for them. For eg: If the user is on the landing page of Amazon when he types Hair dryer the results are shown to him and this makes his navigation easier. This automatically leads to more users visiting the website and increasing their SEO. Voice search- Each year billions of searches are done via voice commands and the number is increasing day by day. This growing trend will create an impact on the keyword optimisation since people don’t speak in the same way we write. This will have a great impact on SEO as everyone expects one correct answer given by a device. Therefore, quality content which provides the most thorough and readable answer becomes a crucial factor in this case. Progressive web-apps- Progressive web-apps are engaging, reliable, fast and convenient to the users. SEO efforts on these apps can be boosted by increasing the level of engagement with the users through an app like experience. For eg: Flipkart app users have a higher level of engagement than its website’s users. Some offers are only for the app users, so this sort of content increases the level of engagement with the users. Blog- To increase the number of users to a particular blog, there should be a unique title that relates to the content of the post. A long tail keyword should be used but only the keyword should not be the title. Eg: How to use tagging in Facebook to the most beneficial way? A catchy description that encourages people to click. Eg: Learn how to use tagging in Facebook to generate more traffic to its link. Newsjacking- Updating information on the basis of current affairs is also appreciated and engages readers in a great manner. If there is a search that suddenly goes popular versus any normal activity then automatically that will give a boost in the search results. For eg: Oreo used newsjacking as one of its tools to promote its product. During Superbowl 2013, when the power went off, Oreo came up with this tweet saying, “Power Out? No problem” with a starkly-lit image of a solitary Oreo and the caption, “You can still dunk in the dark”. This is how brands or even bloggers utilise newsjacking to their advantage. Once the quality and quantity of the content is decided upon, then comes the point where its value is determined. The determination of the valued content depends upon various factors like social shares (higher the number of shares is an indicator of good quality of content), links (the more links acquired calls for a celebration) and comments (usually people do not comment, but if they do then it indicates that the reader is engaged and have a thought about what you have to say). Content is the king. We do not need more content in general but instead we need a more optimised content that engages consumers and makes them reach information that they are actually looking for.
