				<![CDATA[<p>Facebook is usually considered as the king of all the social media platforms. Despite the emergence of several social networking sites, Facebook makes it a point to stay on the top of the chart. Businesses are always focused on reaping the benefits of the popularity of Facebook&#8217;s fan following and daily users to create a firm base of regular customers and clients in the long term. The Facebook algorithm ensures that you focus on the part which works rather than experimenting in every section of Facebook as a business promoting platform. Facebook Algorithm: In today&#8217;s time, if a company is talking about the Facebook algorithm, then it is mainly regarding the news feed algorithm. The news feed algorithm plays a crucial role in the day to day work of the marketers, publishers, brands as well as businesses. So, one needs to stay updated with even a small change announced by Facebook regarding the algorithm. A single change in the Facebook algorithm can have a profound impact on the way your brands or company&#8217;s posts are seen in the news feed of the Facebook users. The Process: One of the significant latest changes which Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg announced was the priority of posts of family members and friends over that of the businesses and brands. In simpler terms, you can now see the posts of your friends and family members across your feed rather than your feed flooded with the promotional posts of brands and companies all the time. The primary intention behind this is to create and motivate meaningful talks and discussions among the Facebook users. In this way, Facebook will be much more clear, and individuals need not have to land up at some promotional post every time they visit Facebook. Also, the news feeds have a limited amount of space. This makes it essential to ensure that it is utilized well for interactive conversations with a limit in the showcase of the posts and videos of different brands across this most prominent social media platform. Benefits of Using Facebook for Marketing: Many of the Facebook marketers and promoters have got shaken to some extent with this new change in the Facebook algorithm. Many of them have already created strategies to execute on Facebook for the new year. But then, Facebook wants something else. It wants every user to focus on proper conversations. This leads to the reduction in the visibility of the posts of brands and companies across the Facebook. If you are a marketer, publisher or brand, you need not worry a lot as you can change your strategies and ensure that the users receive good content whenever they visit Facebook. Facebook live videos are a significant trend, and this makes the brands and companies to try something more visual and live for their audience. Facebook contests are also in quite demanding these days as more number of individuals are interested in participating in them. Quality customer care and service are of prime importance if businesses want to stand out from the crowd and keep their customers happy. Conclusion: You can implement the changes to the Facebook algorithm and utilize the other methods to ensure retaining regular customers. Thus, your marketing efforts will be fruitful in the long term if you follow the Facebook algorithm changes from time to time.</p>
