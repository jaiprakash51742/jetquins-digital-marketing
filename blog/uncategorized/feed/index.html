				<![CDATA[<p>How to Choose the Right Digital Marketing Agency for Your Business in 2024 Selecting a digital marketing agency is not a decision to be taken lightly. You have specific goals in mind, and rushing into a partnership with the first agency you come across can cost you time, money, and potential business growth. Instead, it&#8217;s crucial to take a thoughtful approach and invest time in finding the right fit for your business needs. Here’s a guide to help you make the right decision when choosing a digital marketing agency: 1. Understand Your Business Objectives Before you even start reaching out to agencies, you need a clear understanding of what you want to achieve. Are you looking to drive more traffic to your website, increase sales, or simply build a stronger online presence? Knowing your goals will help you identify which agency can best meet your needs. Without clarity on your objectives, you run the risk of falling into a bad deal, especially when agencies, driven by competition, push their services aggressively. Be sure to evaluate each agency carefully and choose the one that aligns with your business goals. 2. Analyze Your Competitors In today’s digital world, every business is striving to stand out. Studying your competitors’ digital marketing strategies can give you valuable insights into what works and what doesn’t. Look at how they engage their audience, their rankings on search engines, and their social media presence. By understanding your competitors&#8217; tactics, you’ll have a better idea of what kind of digital marketing services you need and which agency can deliver them. Competitors’ strategies can offer inspiration, showing you where your business might be lagging and what kind of agency could help you catch up. 3. Don’t Just Go for the Lowest Price Price is always a consideration, but it shouldn’t be the sole deciding factor. You’ll likely encounter agencies that offer services at significantly lower rates, but beware—lower costs may not always translate into value for money. Assess how these agencies manage to deliver “quality” services at such low prices. Are they cutting corners? Do they have a track record of success? Likewise, paying exorbitant rates doesn&#8217;t guarantee success either. Look for an agency that charges reasonable rates for quality services. A fair deal will ensure the agency has the resources to run high-quality campaigns and foster a professional relationship that drives real results. 4. Choose an Agency with Industry Expertise Not all digital marketing agencies are created equal. It’s essential to choose one with experience in your industry. An agency that understands your market will be able to design more effective campaigns tailored to your specific audience. Once you identify potential agencies, ask them for examples of past work in your industry. Have they helped similar businesses achieve their goals? What kind of results did they deliver? Choosing an agency with a strong portfolio in your niche will save you time and money and lead to better outcomes. 5. Know Your Target Audience When going digital, it&#8217;s essential to have a clear idea of who your target audience is. You need to understand the demographics you’re focusing on and those you want to reach. If you aren’t clear on your target audience, it will be difficult for the agency to deliver effective results. No one knows your customers better than you do, so it’s important to collaborate closely with the agency to ensure your marketing efforts are directed at the right people. 6. Evaluate the Tools and Technologies They Use A digital marketing agency’s success depends heavily on the tools and technologies they use. Whether it’s email marketing, SEO, social media management, or any other service, make sure the agency is using industry-leading tools. For example, for SEO work, you’ll want an agency proficient in tools like Ahrefs, SEMrush, or Moz. For email marketing, tools like MailChimp or Campaign Monitor are essential. Additionally, ensure that communication tools such as Slack or Trello are in place to keep you updated on the progress of campaigns. Understanding the tools they use will give you a sense of their professionalism and technical capabilities, ensuring they’re equipped to handle your business&#8217;s specific needs. Conclusion Choosing the right digital marketing agency is a critical decision that can significantly impact your business’s success. By carefully considering your objectives, evaluating your competitors, assessing pricing, and ensuring the agency has the right industry expertise and tools, you’ll be better positioned to select the right partner. Take your time to weigh your options, and choose a digital marketing agency that aligns with your business goals and can help propel your business forward in 2024.

				<![CDATA[<p>SEO Agency Promises vs Reality in results&#160; Search Engine Optimization (SEO) is a way to keep your website or content at top of Google’s search engine results page (SERPs), the agency you are going to hire for SEO basically optimises your published piece of content to make it worthy for Google’s search engine and work consistently to keep your content at top of search results when an individual searches related to your business niche.&#160; SEO involves various methods and strategies that are adapted to make your website rank high. SEO professionals promise you to keep your page at top of SERP but generally, they fail to do so because of incompetency and lack of experience.&#160; When you are looking for an SEO agency to hire you must be very cautious about what they are promising and how they are going to do the work because reality is usually not what they promise.&#160; There are SEO agencies who are going to approach you and guarantee top ranking, a list of leads of prospective customers and high traffic to your website. But the results in reality are far from these guarantees. There are some agencies that assure to refund the amount if they don&#8217;t meet the expectations which is a way to mislead.&#160; Before you are going to make a deal with an SEO agency you must be capable of differentiating between genuine service providers and fake service providers. This can be done if you have knowledge about how SEO functions in reality and what expertise is required for a good SEO. Getting deceived by an SEO agency that guarantees fake results can lose your confidence in SEO which is a very important part of your marketing campaigns. FAKE PROMISES VS REALITY BY SEO AGENCY&#160; In order to understand which agency is offering unrealistic results and which is offering genuine results, you must be aware of some common fake promises that are guaranteed by agencies, to get you on their client&#8217;s list.&#160; Duration of Results&#160; Promise&#160; There are some SEO professionals who are going to guarantee you quick results, such as within a week or few days they can drive your website to the top on Google’s SERP. To get the deal done with you they even promise you a free trial to generate high traffic within a week. In such a short span of time the traffic which your site receives can never be organic, it can be done to just close the deal with you.&#160; Reality&#160; In reality, SEO takes time to show its power. If you are willing to get desired results through SEO then you must be very patient as it usually takes more than a month or months to even get to 1st page of Google’s SERP. The reason behind this is that there are already top rankers whose content material is so strong that to get above or even close to them requires so much dedication and patience. If you want to get organic traffic, leads and top-ranking then being patient is the key to these accomplishments. Guaranteed Results&#160; Promise&#160; Any SEO agency that is offering you 100% guaranteed results in all aspects of an SEO campaign then they are definitely not the one you should go for. They will try to deceive you by saying that they guarantee you leads for sales, optimise the content to rank at the top and provide consistent traffic to the marketing campaigns.&#160; Reality&#160; Trying their best is in the agency’s hands but getting results as expected is not in their hands. SEO involves so many factors to give 100% results and putting all those factors in one place demands fine investment and time.&#160; It is the Google Algorithms that have control over SEO and only they can decide whether you will get expected results or not. An SEO agency can just try their best to meet all the protocols of the Google Algorithm which is done by creating quality content, choosing top ranking keywords and appropriate backlink generation.&#160; The competition to trend at the first page of SERP is very intense as top SEO experts develop strategies for organisations and only they are able to rank at the top. So if any agency promises you guaranteed results you must check their history cautiously. An agency that shows you a real picture of the SEO process and promises to do its best is the agency you should choose.&#160; Traffic and Sales generation&#160; Promise&#160; SEO professionals promise to give you results like high engagement and conversions through campaigns. If they are not adequately adept and experienced this becomes a blunder instead of favourable results.&#160; There are agencies that don’t have enough resources and a team of adepts still assures conversion which is very easy to commit but tough as rock to crack. Generally, the startups make such promises due to the pressure of onboarding you as their client but they are not efficient and resourceful to do this.&#160; Reality&#160; SEO helps in the conversion of leads and generating traffic through campaigns but only highly efficient agencies are capable of getting this done. At the end of the month, there are chances that you get deals closed through SEO campaigns.&#160; Possible only when the right audience is targeted in the right area. For this strong SEO strategies must be developed which is done on the basis of your business niche. If an SEO agency puts its efforts in the wrong direction then it’s a waste of time and money both.&#160; Staying at Top forever&#160; Promise&#160; One more promise that SEO agencies make to grab your attention is that your website will stay at the top of Google&#8217;s SERP ‘forever’ once it reaches that place. They might try to comfort you just by saying that once you reach the top there is nothing to do further. This is not true, because Google’s algorithm keeps changing which keeps shuffling the pages up and down. Beware of the agency that promises you will always be at the first page or at the top without disclosing to you the actual efforts it takes.&#160; Reality&#160; Staying at the top forever is not a thing that exists in reality. Whether it’s life or SEO there are always fluctuations of positions because there are plenty of other brands that are also doing their best to rank at the top. Also, SEO is not something that’s done one time, one has to work on it consistently and follow the latest trends of Google’s search engine.&#160; Every year Google announces many changes and updates which impacts the SEO as well. In order to stay relevant and keep your page on track, the SEO strategies also need to be updated accordingly.&#160; To keep your website at the top the SEO experts have to comply with every protocol and develop unique and fresh content so that when Google crawls your website your work still looks worthy to be at the top.&#160; Let&#8217;s get you across how SEO actually works&#160; When you are looking to hire an SEO agency you aim to rank your website at the top or at least at the first page of search results in Google. This one purpose involves so many aspects that need to be analysed meticulously by SEO experts.&#160; A quality SEO is the most significant factor in order to serve its purpose. The Search Engine crawls all the websites which are available related to a particular niche. If the crawler finds relevant keywords, quality content and backlinking of your website then it chooses to position your website on the first page or at the top of SERP.&#160; Google is concerned about how it can display the best content to its audience because people trust Google and showing fake results will take that trust away from google. So Google takes it as their responsibility to show the best content to the audience and there are certain protocols and methods which need to be followed to become the best in the eyes of Google.&#160; If your website is optimised as per the search engine demands then there are ample benefits you get such as, it helps expand your business reach to more potential customers, increases chances of getting more organic engagement on your website, improves your brand visibility and awareness, helps maintain credibility if search engine displays your website at the first page or at top.&#160; Whom to pick?&#160; After reading the above phrases you might be completely baffled about how to pick the right SEO agency for your business.

				<![CDATA[<p>CONTENT SPINNING AND CONTENT REPURPOSING, both concepts are about how you are using old or existing content for new Digital marketing aims. But their ways of performing in the Digital marketing world are very much different. Before we get into the core, let’s get familiar with a brief explanation of the differences between them to proceed with a clear mind. When you are doing Content Spinning you are changing the phrases, sentences, entire paragraphs or replacing major words with synonyms of the existing article. The end document looks completely new but it is not the case actually. It does not originate with your content ideas so it is considered a duplicate.&#160; When you are doing Content Repurposing you are recycling existing content or some elements of the content. The purpose here is to reach new audiences via new platforms with the same article. The end document is the same as the previous one but envisioned for a completely new purpose and in a new format.&#160; From here onwards we will discuss the definition of both the concepts separately and know which one is more prominent in the Digital world.&#160; UNDERSTANDING CONTENT SPINNING&#160; Content Spinning is a method of writing for SEO and other digital marketing platforms. It is a way of creating new content without actually creating new content, done by making changes in the existing article and replacing the words. It’s a technique of giving the false impression that you have written this whole thing as new.&#160; As mentioned above, when you are doing Content Spinning you are changing the phrases, sentences, entire paragraphs or replacing major words with synonyms of the existing article. The end document looks completely new but it is not the case actually. It does not originate with your content ideas so it is considered a duplicate.&#160; For performing content spinning there are tools available but you can do it manually as well. The biggest drawback here is that the tools used are more likely to give a vague final copy because these tools only switch the words with synonyms and rephrase the sentences without considering the actual intent of those words and the sentence. Spinning the content is usually not recommended by Digital experts but for those who still want to use content spinning, they can use the best-paid tools such as the Best Spinner, Chimp Rewriter, SpinBot, WordAI and SpinnerChief. These tools can be used to maintain the authenticity of the article and are still capable of replacing a text, switching the words around, and altering the whole layout of the content. Because these tools are usually accessed after subscription the quality they provide is also premium, they can spin your content to another level of profundity. How Content Spinning Can Be Helpful For digital marketing campaigns and most significantly for SEO, the spinning of the content is preferred by the writers because of the fact that the high ranking quality content and well-written content about a particular niche is required for generating traffic and for ranking at top of Google’s SERP. Taking ideas from others’ articles and spinning them into your style fulfils the above requirement of campaigns. The spinning in this way is effective and can serve as influential as new content if it is formed in different versions including high-ranking words and a well-framed structure. Content Spinning is still considered useful for SEO purposes because the spun content is effective in ranking at SERP and Google algorithms look for an original piece of content, check the quality and backlinks of the content. But there are chances that Google crawlers might notice the oddity in your spun content and mark it as black-hat. So if you want to accomplish your marketing goals via content spinning you must be very cautious and focused on the authenticity of the content. Applying Content Spinning to Existing Content&#160; There can be plenty of content that you can pick from your or others’ published work and try to spin it but not all content is going to be effective. So it is important to analyse which content applying content spinning can give the finest result. Usually, content spinning is applied by changing the words, rephrasing the sentences, adding more new words, as the replacement fits in the existing context. When you are trying to modify the content you must keep in mind that your final copy must look totally different from the original content, so when Google crawlers check the authenticity of your spun content then the overall structure must be deemed different and fresh content. Spinning content is not considered a good thing for your business image but if all the above protocols of content spinning are followed properly then you can get rid of the risk of getting your business image damaged. UNDERSTANDING CONTENT REPURPOSING&#160; This concept is gaining great importance in the Digital world at high momentum. The content creators are approached more for repurposing content as it enables the old tale to shine again. Recycling the existing article for a different purpose for a different set of audiences makes this option more preferable when compared to spinning content. As mentioned above, when you are doing Content Repurposing you are recycling an existing article or some elements of the article. The purpose here is to reach new audiences via new platforms with the same article. The end document is the same as the previous one but envisioned for a completely new purpose and in a new format. You can repurpose the written articles, posts, videos and even graphics. The matter of work which you have already used in any other platform or way you can use it on another platform in some other way.&#160; This is very effective in saving time and energy yet giving favourable results if repurposed properly.&#160; For example, if you have published a post with a graphic on Instagram you can repurpose the graphic image for other marketing campaigns. If you have published a video then you can turn it into a podcast. You can use the script of the video for your website page. These are some common ways of repurposing your content, and one thing to keep in mind is that you should be the owner of the content you are going to use for repurposing. How Content Repurposing Can Be Helpful&#160; You invest a lot of time and energy in creating content worth watching or reading. Using that content one time for limited eyes sounds quite unfair. Content repurposing allows you to reuse your best work again and bring it in front of new eyes. There are many benefits that you can get as a marketeer when you repurpose the previous content with a new aim and vision. More Reach To Target Audiences Content that you posted or uploaded before might have reached the limited audience of that particular platform. If you want to expand the audience for your content then reusing the same content in a different style on another platform can fulfil your purpose. The old content that you published might not be able to meet your expectations in terms of traffic generation so you can try to get those results again from different mediums, this time the perspective of the target audience can also be different due to the changed circumstances. Also, content repurposing covers different portions of the audience, meaning some prefer exploring particular content through video and some prefer reading an article. So publishing single content through different platforms covers all choices of people. Reminder For Audience On Important Aspects People tend to explore some content and forget it later. When they are in need of your services they don’t think about your campaign that was published before and have no idea how your services can be helpful for them. If you revive the old post again and bring it insight of your audience in a different style then there are possibilities to get leads that were skipped earlier. If there are some services that you want to promote the most, getting it done through Content repurposing can be an efficient way of marketing. Applying Content Repurposing to Existing Content When you are going to repurpose the content for your new campaign then you must consider some important aspects before choosing which content you must use for content repurposing. While brainstorming the previous content you should look for a piece of content that received the highest reach, popularity and delivered favourable consequences. Consider the type of content you are going to create and analyse if it met your expectations when it was published before. Among the list of published content examine the current newsworthiness of the topic. Choosing content that is currently trending most is the best content to repurpose. If the same content didn’t gain popularity previously doesn’t mean it can not gain popularity now. The marketing stats and trends keep changing so the type of content you are going to repurpose must have its importance today.</p>

				<![CDATA[<p>SEO in 2022 is envisioned to drive so much traffic to your site that you may need to call a traffic cop!&#160; Search engine optimization(SEO) has evolved to be an essential part of every business in 2022. The most significant causality for this evolution is the circumstances that occurred post lockdown due to Covid-19. Numerous portions of Audiences switched towards digital platforms which were a favourable condition for businesses online.&#160; In the year 2021, the digital world had a huge jump which includes the SEO industry. There were remarkable enhancements in Google algorithms, Core web vitals and overall user experience. 2022 is expected to add more exciting and sterling features to the SEO industry globally, such as advancement in Artificial Intelligence and Original content framing.&#160; In 2022 the SEO aces are looking forward to enhancing the overall Google search experience by intensifying machine learning, mobile-friendliness and accessibility of the pages and also Top SEO practitioners are taking initiatives in coaching others on the tactics and strategies of SEO.&#160; The more we are moving towards the end of 2022, the more we can see the updates and modifications in Google algorithm, AI impact on SEO and natural language processing without losing focus on rendering a sounder and organic user experience.&#160; SEO has continued to maintain its authenticity by providing audiences with genuine search intent which is done via optimizing keywords organically, enabling accessibility to vast topic research and developing a sound content strategy for SEO.&#160; The importance of EAT signals is ought to be levelling up and the companies working on YMYL SEO categories are still receiving advanced scrutiny from Google, which usually leads their ranking to be more volatile in search results.&#160; In 2022 the SEO is all about accelerating business growth, meeting customers expectations in the course of purchasing services or goods, including optimal AI usage and automation techniques.&#160; Seo has evolved in the following ways in 2022:&#160; ENHANCED USER EXPERIENCE Google is frequently updating and improving the user experience via growth and expansion of machine learning components and enhancing search algorithms. Previously also some important updates had been made like RankBrain in 2015, Mobile-First Indexing in 2017, Neural-Matching in 2018, and latest this year’s Page Experience Update.&#160; The page experience update focuses on user experience majorly assessing sites based on analyzing how steady and smoothly they load, how they function like mobile-friendliness, domain security (HTTPS) and on-site ad spam.&#160; Earlier when this update was announced it didn’t seem to be of much importance in the SEO industry but as we see the trends in 2022 this update seems to have more impact on SEO. This can be the strategy of Google also, because before major businesses were not ready and failed to address core web vitals fruitfully. But now the scope for this update is expected to expand. In 2022 it is expected that mobile experience will be continued to be paramount and gain more space, at least until mobile-first indexing is complete&#160; BACKLINKS REMAINS FUNDAMENTAL After 2020 people are more involved in uploading information on the internet and more people are exploring the information without considering if that information is organic or not.&#160; To stay organic, Google will place more value on backlink equity for SEO rankings. For those who are not aware of Link Equity, it is the value a site provides by linking to your site, influenced by domain authority, current Google rankings, and other metrics.&#160; In 2022 any good SEO strategy consists of strong backlinks building. If the backlinks are optimized properly in your site it would drive google algorithms to comprehend the trustworthiness of your site enabling visitors to land on your page through higher rankings. Backlinks play a vital role in top ranking factors of SEO, the usage of your site link in another site greatly impacts where your page is going to rank on google search results of a particular niche.&#160; The reason why google algorithms consider backlinking for ranking is that when a site chooses their content to link with your site content it’s giving Google a signal that your content is worth something which is why you are recommended by Google. In 2022 those who want to trend must start working hard on backlinking to let google find you.&#160; AI IS APPLIED EXTENSIVELY The usage of Artificial intelligence is increasing remarkably in every type of Digital platform including SEO. AI has drastically advanced the way audiences explore topics online specifically via google search. The AI has enabled users to see the content of their choice and enhances the searches on google.&#160; This has become possible because AI technologies can work on numerous quantities of data at higher speeds than a human being can. From chatbots to data analysis to content generation, AI is the top-notch approach for the SEO industry in 2022 and further. It helps analyse the information and drive it to automate various marketing tasks.&#160; What are the latest changes that happened? Unquestionably, Google keeps announcing hundreds of modifications every year in the search engine algorithm. If your page is at the top of Google’s SERP (search engine results page) at this very moment that doesn’t mean you are going to stay there for the rest of the year unless you keep your SEO strategies up to date with the latest updates of Google.&#160; There are plenty of sites that contain the same content your site contains but all can’t rank on SERP. To stay on top of the SERP, you must follow the latest protocols of Google SEO, for which you must be aware of the latest changes in SEO:&#160; -BERT UPDATE was created and published in 2018 by Jacob Devlin and his colleagues from Google. Google declared that it had begun leveraging BERT in its Search Engine and by late 2020 it was using BERT in almost every English-language query.&#160; BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) is Google’s neural network-based technique for natural language processing (NLP). It enables comprehension of the nuances and context of words in search engines and helps to better match those niche queries with more relevant results, as demonstrated by Google.&#160; -Broad Core Algorithm Update, announced by Google in the year 2020, is the very first Algorithm update informed via the official Twitter account of Google search liaison.&#160; This update majorly includes an up-gradation to the overall Google algorithm used to better understand the search intent of users. Under this update, Google doesn’t target sites of any particular niche or ranking signals, such as organic content, there’s nothing to do with these modifications to boost your rating if it is lost as a result.&#160; Here you can emphasize more on, building backlinks, sending social signals and creating quality content. This enables the algorithm to be updated several times a year but broad core updates usually happen in order to incorporate the latest features into the Google algorithm which impacts how the pages are listed in SERP ranking.&#160; -Maverick Update is among many minor modifications that Google introduces every year as a routine. The update is named by Webmaster World’s Brett Table in reaction to significant changes in the search results and the traffic reported.&#160; There is always doubt about whether google considers these verticals or website elements changes more favourably or not going forward. Just like all other minor changes in the Google algorithm this update has not been found to enable overall changes in the SERP scenario.&#160; Nonetheless, Google introduces plenty of modifications in the algorithm every year that many get unnoticed but this update has the power to influence SEO more than other updates.&#160; -Google Mobile Speed Update is done with the vision to make page speed a ranking factor in the search results in mobile. Around 52-54% of mobile users exit a page that takes a loading time of more than 3 sec and the average loading time for the sites on a mobile device is 15 seconds.&#160; The time your site is taking to load impacts a lot on how much traffic will be there and what will be the ranking of your page on Google’s search results. As per Google’s stats, if page load time increases from 1 to 10 seconds, the bouncing rate increases around 120% which significantly affects the ranking on SERP. This update allows Google Search Console to display that your ranking is fluctuating due to slow site speed on mobile which occurs due to slower mobile sites leading to less traffic on your site. Google declared that this update only impacts the slowest mobile sites.&#160; Everyone wants to stand out on the Search Engine Result Pages (SERPs) but only a few can maintain their site on top of rankings. The major reason behind this is that they might have observed all the updates that Google makes in search engines algorithm. So it is important to keep in mind the latest trends of SEO that Google introduces every year while developing your SEO strategy.</p>

<p>BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) is Google’s neural network-based technique for natural language processing (NLP). It enables comprehension of the nuances and context of words in search engines and helps to better match those niche queries with more relevant results, as demonstrated by Google.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>-Broad Core Algorithm Update, </strong>announced by Google in the year 2020, is the very first Algorithm update informed via the official Twitter account of Google search liaison.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This update majorly includes an up-gradation to the overall Google algorithm used to better understand the search intent of users. Under this update, Google doesn’t target sites of any particular niche or ranking signals, such as organic content, there’s nothing to do with these modifications to boost your rating if it is lost as a result.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Here you can emphasize more on, building backlinks, sending social signals and creating quality content. This enables the algorithm to be updated several times a year but broad core updates usually happen in order to incorporate the latest features into the Google algorithm which impacts how the pages are listed in SERP ranking.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>-Maverick Update </strong>is among many minor modifications that Google introduces every year as a routine. The update is named by Webmaster World’s Brett Table in reaction to significant changes in the search results and the traffic reported.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There is always doubt about whether google considers these verticals or website elements changes more favourably or not going forward. Just like all other minor changes in the Google algorithm this update has not been found to enable overall changes in the SERP scenario.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Nonetheless, Google introduces plenty of modifications in the algorithm every year that many get unnoticed but this update has the power to influence SEO more than other updates.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>-Google Mobile Speed Update</strong> is done with the vision to make page speed a ranking factor in the search results in mobile. Around 52-54% of mobile users exit a page that takes a loading time of more than 3 sec and the average loading time for the sites on a mobile device is 15 seconds.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The time your site is taking to load impacts a lot on how much traffic will be there and what will be the ranking of your page on Google’s search results. As per Google’s stats, if page load time increases from 1 to 10 seconds, the bouncing rate increases around 120% which significantly affects the ranking on SERP.</p>



<p>This update allows Google Search Console to display that your ranking is fluctuating due to slow site speed on mobile which occurs due to slower mobile sites leading to less traffic on your site. Google declared that this update only impacts the slowest mobile sites.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Everyone wants to stand out on the Search Engine Result Pages (SERPs) but only a few can maintain their site on top of rankings. The major reason behind this is that they might have observed all the updates that Google makes in search engines algorithm. So it is important to keep in mind the latest trends of SEO that Google introduces every year while developing your SEO strategy.</p>

				<![CDATA[<p>Expert analysis We live in a digital world where every sec a new thing happens we are immediately updated about it. The digital marketing revolution has launched a new era of human empowerment both in terms of personal and professional. Digital is the need of the hour and as stated by Bill Gates, “The internet is becoming the town square for the global village of tomorrow”. Marketing being an indispensable part for not only business development but also for augmenting brand awareness, it’s important to analyze and understand which kind of marketing will have a long-lasting impact on the users. According to Philip Kotler, one of the preeminent marketing minds, a leading expert on strategic marketing and the forefather of social marketing, &#8221;Marketing is not the art of finding clever ways to dispose of what you make. It is the art of creating genuine customer value. It is the art of helping your customers become better off. The marketer&#8217;s watchwords are quality, service, and value&#8221;. However the raging debate between digital marketing and traditional marketing is a persistent one, reason being, though most of the marketing is done in the traditional way, digital marketing is steadily gaining an edge. Traditional marketing Traditional marketing is one of the conventional methods of advertising. It is used since the inception of advertising. It incorporates different forms of marketing starting from print, broadcast to direct mail marketing. This encompasses the following: Newspaper Television Radio Flyers, pamphlets, brochures Billboards Magazine ads Digital Marketing Traditional marketing includes all the 4Ps of marketing- Product, Price, Promotion and Place, while when it comes to digital marketing, primary focus is given on promotion wherein the product/service can get more exposure and response. Digital marketing encompasses all digital channels such as search engines, social media, email, and their websites to promote the brand/ service as well to generate sales. It aids in direct connection with the target audience. Advantage of Digital Marketing over Traditional Marketing Both traditional marketing and digital marketing has its own perks. With the advent of new age digital technologies, there is no doubt that internet marketing has set a new revolution altogether. Digital marketing has some clear winning benefits over traditional marketing and some of those are mentioned below. 1. Comparatively Low Cost Advertising and marketing is a vital part of any business, but certainly it’s a costly affair. While shelling out money might be comparatively easy for big businesses, for small businesses or start-up companies, it is quite difficult. However, marketing via digital platforms is more affordable as compared to the traditional method. With just a bare minimum investment, you can subscribe to an email marketing provider and send emails to thousands of customers. While on the other hand marketing through the newspaper, television and other such media ads cost a lot. 2. Higher Return On Investment For any company or business, all that matters the most is the return on investment. Digital marketing offers a significant return on small investments. Be it email marketing or running advertising campaigns on social media platforms, it’s always cost-effective when compared to traditional marketing techniques. 3. Real Time Result In case of traditional marketing you actually can’t track everything and do not get to see the results immediately. It takes a longer time to evaluate the precision of a campaign. Whereas in case of digital marketing it is easy to comprehend the success rate of the digital campaign. You can know whether a campaign is running successfully or not instantly. It is also easy to measure, for instance the number of views, the conversion rate, the engagement rate and so on. 4. Brand Development Every small or big company needs branding to some extent, even in case of lead generation, it is very important for the company to be visible and available for the target audience. It is mostly through a brand awareness campaign that a company reaches its visibility. However when the question arises about which particular type of marketing is more effective, digital or traditional marketing, digital marketing takes the winning position. A well-developed website, a high quality blog and useful articles, a social media channel, are some of the ways by which a business can create brand awareness. Unlike traditional marketing, you can consistently build the image of your company and whenever you want. 5. More Interactive When we talk about traditional marketing, we are reminded of methods that are informative but not interactive in true sense. After reading a newspaper you can at the most discuss that amongst people or just keep it to yourself. Even when you see any billboard, you react to it or max to max take an initiative if you are one of the target audiences. You can not only interact with your targeted audience in the real time, but also make prompt and fruitful steps based on their feedbacks. 6. Target-specific In case of traditional form of marketing device, it is not always possible to cover a certain area or population or just focus on one part of the population and ignore the rest. As opposed to this, digital marketing has the ability to reach out to the whole world or you can even set your specific target audience accordingly. In case of digital marketing, you can retarget the audience based on their likings and preferences. Even a person has a choice to see an ad or ignore, participate in a social media discussion group or read or ignore a marketing email. 7. Sharable As digital marketing uses internet marketing, it is easy for anyone to share the ads or the articles across different platforms and with multiple followers. This in turn enhances the visibility of the service/product or the company, which again aids in increasing the sales and create better brand awareness. 8. Trackable With digital marketing accurately measuring your marketing efforts, tracking each penny that you spend, it becomes very easy and quick to gauge the success rate of an ad campaign. You can instantly see which strategy is working and which isn’t through Google Analytics, inbound traffic, conversion rate, interested audience, bounce rate and profit. 9. Globally Accessible The world is now said to have turned into a global village. There has been a paradigm shift with digitalization. Now anyone, sitting in any corner of the world can see any ad campaign whenever they want. Digitalization is bringing everyone closer and enhancing a more integral and connected world than ever before. Steve Irvine, Vice President of Global Partnerships for Facebook had some insights on “Personalized Marketing at Scale”. He stated in a conference “When marketing via mobile, you are competing with family and friends. So be smart and targeted. Facebook is getting 4 billion video views per day! The average person checks Facebook on their phone 14 times a day. On Facebook you are competing with everything, so targeting is the key! Smartphone is the driver of digital today.” Nevertheless the key to staying relevant and keeping customers in this highly competitive world is to ensure a continuous engagement with the target audience. We are constantly progressing towards a digital world with each passing day and with the above stated facts it’s almost clear that digital marketing has a profound impact when it comes to branding or generating revenue. According to Philip Kotler, “it will be foolish for any company to go overboard on digital media. Companies should use a mix of social and traditional media to promote products. They can experiment with the amount of digital media that is optimal but it is unlikely that companies will only use digital marketing. Companies often need a 30-second commercial that gives a big picture of the brand and then use social media on the back of it. Social and traditional media can reinforce each other and work together.”</p>

				<![CDATA[<p>We are in the last quarter of 2017 and it’s important to get a sense of what’s next in the path of digital transformation. This year, we have already had a glimpse of the top marketing trends such as Big Data, User Experience, smart machines and other industry-specific changes. If you are planning your digital marketing strategy and budget for 2018, you’ll benefit from knowing the top trends in digital marketing. So here we go. 1.) Machine Learning As per a ‘Think with Google’ report, about 97% of business leaders believe that collaboration between clever human marketers and machine learning-based automation entities is the future of marketing. KellyOGC India predicts that the demand for AI and machine learning specialists in India is going to see a whopping 60% rise in 2018, thanks to increasing adoption of automation. Consumers are as tech savvy as they are demanding today. The ability to respond quickly and accurately to consumer queries/demands is often the game changer. Machine learning helps business entities respond swiftly and accurately by providing nuggets of predictive data (both structured and unstructured). &#160; The impact of Machine Learning is already felt in Healthcare and Fraud Detection industries. For instance , PayPal is using predictive technology to bust money laundering and in 2018 the online payment system is going to step up the game with automated data visualization and content management and analysis. 2) Dark social Today people are not confined to just sharing links to content (articles, podcasts, videos and images) on their social platforms. They are connecting and engaging socially via less monitored channels and this kind of social sharing which can’t be accurately tracked by web analytics is ‘dark social’. Market reports show that dark social will drive almost 84% of outbound sharing. Given the fact that it is driven by mobile and messaging, dark social is growing by leaps and bounds – a clear sign for businesses to take this seriously when planning social media marketing strategy in 2018. 3.) Micro Moments When you need to know, go or buy, you often rely on your phone. Over 96% users do the same – use their smartphones for ‘quick search’ on the spot. With increasingly more number of users making such ‘spot decisions’, we will probably see a significant rise in micro-moments in 2018. Not surprisingly, mobile-first websites will play a pivotal role in providing instant information upon immediate consumer request. 4.) Video Ads Videos are ruling the internet right now. Over 52%of marketing professionals worldwide strongly believe that video content gets the highest ROI. Coincidentally, about 43% of users said they’d like to see more video content from marketers. Facebook’s recent 6-second ad format is a hit with consumers. YouTube, Snapchat and Twitter are also in the race for catchy, crisp and engaging video content. &#160;In 2018, it’s expected that many brands will leverage video ads for meaningful customer engagement and plan their advertising budgets accordingly. 5.) Personalization In 2018, personalized user experience will be a ‘basic consumer demand’ as opposed to ‘consumer expectation’. Business organizations are using AI to deliver an individualized experience to each customer. Companies have realized the potential and have planned resources and efforts toward personalization. About 67% of them are expecting a 6%-10% hike in annual revenue from personalization strategy. Overall, year 2018 will be very exciting for marketers and consumers alike with a variety of technology and tools coming into play. How these innovations and advances are going to fare in the market remains to be seen.These are the top trends in Digital Marketing in 2018. We will talk about the top trends in content marketing in our next post. &#160;</p>
