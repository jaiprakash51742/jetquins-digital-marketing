				<![CDATA[<p>5 Reasons to Choose Digital Marketing as a Career in 2024 The digital marketing landscape has evolved significantly since 2017, offering more opportunities and excitement for those looking to embark on a career in this field. With the global shift towards online platforms, digital marketing has become an essential skill across industries. Whether you&#8217;re starting your career, transitioning from another field, or looking to leverage your creativity, digital marketing offers limitless possibilities. Here are five compelling reasons to choose digital marketing as your career in 2024: 1. Diverse Opportunities Regardless of Educational Background One of the greatest advantages of digital marketing is its inclusivity—there&#8217;s no rigid entry barrier in terms of formal education. You don’t need a degree in marketing to get started; digital marketing welcomes people from various fields and educational backgrounds. Whether you’re a creative individual with a knack for social media, a content writer with a flair for words, or someone with analytical skills eager to delve into data, digital marketing has a place for you. This field is skill-based, and you can quickly upskill through online courses, certifications, and hands-on experience. Whether you specialize in social media marketing, content creation, email marketing, or data analytics, you can build a rewarding career by honing your talents and applying them in unique ways. The flexibility and adaptability of this field mean that you can carve out a niche that suits your strengths. 2. Creativity Has No Age Limit Digital marketing is a field that values creativity over age or experience. Unlike traditional roles that may become monotonous over time, digital marketing constantly challenges you to think creatively and come up with innovative solutions. Whether you&#8217;re in your 20s or your 50s, digital marketing allows you to experiment with new ideas, explore uncharted territory, and engage with a dynamic audience. The field thrives on the fresh perspectives and original ideas that come from thinking outside the box. As the digital landscape continues to evolve, so too do the opportunities for creative expression. This is a career where being curious and staying &#8220;hungry&#8221; for new ideas—just like Steve Jobs encouraged—can keep you engaged and thriving at any age. 3. Be at the Forefront of Global Trends Digital marketing is one of the fastest-growing and most dynamic industries worldwide. From politics to finance, education to entertainment, every sector is shifting to a digital-first approach. Major trends like the rise of artificial intelligence, blockchain technology, and the ongoing growth of e-commerce are driving demand for skilled digital marketers who can keep up with these rapid changes. As a digital marketer, you&#8217;ll be at the forefront of these trends, playing a key role in shaping how businesses engage with customers and how societies communicate. With governments and businesses alike pushing for digital transformation, digital marketing skills are in high demand globally. Being part of this shift positions you as a valuable player in a rapidly evolving digital world. 4. Career Growth in Both Jobs and Startups Digital marketing offers remarkable opportunities for career growth, whether you&#8217;re working for a large corporation or a startup. Global giants like Amazon, Google, and Accenture continue to invest heavily in digital marketing, creating high-demand job opportunities for professionals at all levels. As you gain experience, there’s potential for rapid advancement, whether through promotions, specialization in a particular area, or transitioning into leadership roles. Additionally, if entrepreneurship appeals to you, digital marketing provides an ideal foundation for starting your own business. The relatively low barrier to entry means that with the right skills and a solid strategy, you can launch your own digital marketing agency, consultancy, or even a niche business. Startups in digital marketing are booming, with investment firms like SoftBank recognizing the vast potential for growth and revenue in this field. Whether you prefer the stability of corporate life or the thrill of entrepreneurship, digital marketing offers avenues for both. 5. A Flexible and Dynamic Work Culture One of the most appealing aspects of a career in digital marketing is the flexibility it offers. Unlike many traditional roles, digital marketing doesn’t come with strict office hours, formal dress codes, or rigid hierarchies. The work culture in this field tends to be more relaxed and focused on creativity, innovation, and results rather than micromanagement. Digital marketing also allows for remote work and flexible hours, meaning you can work from anywhere as long as you have a laptop and a stable internet connection. This flexibility makes it easier to achieve a healthy work-life balance, reducing burnout and making work more enjoyable. Whether you prefer working from a coffee shop, your home office, or while traveling, digital marketing adapts to your lifestyle. Moreover, digital marketing teams often foster a collaborative and fun environment, with a focus on creativity and continuous learning. The informal culture—often characterized by team bonding, idea-sharing, and brainstorming—makes it a refreshing and dynamic career choice. Conclusion: Why Digital Marketing Is Your Double Shot Espresso Digital marketing is more than just a job—it’s a career filled with endless opportunities for growth, creativity, and innovation. The field welcomes individuals from diverse backgrounds, encourages lifelong learning, and offers flexibility and excitement at every turn. Whether you’re looking to climb the corporate ladder or launch your own startup, digital marketing equips you with the skills and freedom to design the career of your dreams. In 2024, the demand for digital marketing professionals continues to rise, making it one of the most sought-after careers. So grab your laptop, sharpen your skills, and get ready to thrive in a career that’s as dynamic as it is rewarding.

				<![CDATA[<p>SEO Practices That Will Help You Rank Better in 2024 Patna, with its rapid growth as a tech hub, has become a breeding ground for numerous startups and multinational companies vying for a dominant position in the digital market. In this competitive landscape, Search Engine Optimization (SEO) has emerged as a vital strategy to drive organic leads. With SEO evolving rapidly, especially in 2024, keeping up with the latest practices is essential to ensure your business thrives in the digital space. SEO is no longer just about identifying keywords; it’s about optimizing content, improving user experience, and adapting to the ever-changing algorithms that search engines like Google use to rank websites. In this article, we’ll explore the most effective SEO practices for 2024 and how they can help you achieve better rankings and drive more traffic. SEO Practices for Driving Better Traffic in 2024 1. Choosing the Right SEO Agency Matters Choosing the right SEO agency for your business is critical to your success. But how do you make the right choice? It’s essential to consider factors such as the agency’s Google ranking, its portfolio of clients, and its credibility. Some agencies may promise overnight success or a sudden surge in traffic, but these quick fixes can backfire. Rapid increases in traffic achieved through unethical practices could lead to penalties or even de-indexing by Google, damaging your brand&#8217;s online presence. An SEO agency that adheres to ethical practices will focus on sustainable growth, which is crucial in today’s competitive market. At Jetquins Travels, for instance, we emphasize long-term success by employing SEO strategies that comply with search engine guidelines. We understand that each business is unique, and our customized approach ensures that we deliver value-driven results without the risk of penalties. 2. Keyword Research and Optimization Keyword research remains one of the most fundamental aspects of SEO, but it has evolved significantly in 2024. It’s no longer just about finding high-volume keywords; today, you need to focus on search intent and user behavior. Understanding the context behind keywords and aligning them with the intent of your target audience is essential for driving relevant traffic to your site. For example, rather than targeting broad, highly competitive keywords, modern SEO strategies incorporate long-tail keywords and semantic search to attract more qualified leads. This nuanced approach helps deliver better results while ensuring that your content aligns with what users are actually looking for. 3. On-Page Optimization and Technical SEO On-page optimization plays a crucial role in ensuring your content is discoverable by both users and search engines. In 2024, on-page SEO includes optimizing title tags, meta descriptions, headers, and image alt texts, while ensuring that your content is engaging and easy to navigate. Incorporating structured data or schema markup into your pages helps search engines understand the context of your content, leading to better visibility in search results. Technical SEO is equally important. It includes improving site speed, ensuring mobile-friendliness, optimizing for voice search, and maintaining a secure (HTTPS) website. Technical SEO is the backbone of your website’s performance and directly affects user experience, which is a key ranking factor. Websites that are optimized for speed, security, and accessibility are more likely to rank higher on search engine results pages (SERPs). 4. Local SEO for Targeting Nearby Customers Local SEO has become increasingly important for businesses that rely on local customers. Whether you&#8217;re running a restaurant, law firm, or healthcare practice, local SEO helps your business show up in search results when users search for services “near me.” In 2024, local SEO remains crucial for capturing hyper-local audiences who are ready to make purchasing decisions. Optimizing your Google Business Profile, managing online reviews, and ensuring your website is location-specific are all essential components of local SEO. For businesses like hotels, cleaning services, or restaurants, local SEO ensures that your business appears in local search results and Google Maps, driving more foot traffic and conversions from customers in your immediate vicinity. 5. Content Optimization for Voice and AI Search Artificial intelligence and voice search are two significant trends shaping SEO in 2024. With more people using voice assistants like Siri, Alexa, and Google Assistant, optimizing for voice search is now a priority. Voice search queries tend to be longer and more conversational, so your content must be optimized to answer these queries directly. AI-driven search engines are also becoming more sophisticated, using machine learning to understand context and deliver more relevant results. To optimize for AI-powered search engines, your content must focus on answering user questions comprehensively while providing a seamless user experience. Content quality is also essential. Google’s E-A-T (Expertise, Authoritativeness, Trustworthiness) guidelines remain a critical ranking factor. By creating high-quality, authoritative content that answers user questions and provides value, you can improve your chances of ranking higher. 6. Google’s Constant Algorithm Updates Google’s algorithms are constantly evolving, with thousands of updates every year to ensure the most relevant results are delivered to users. These updates affect how websites are ranked, and staying up to date with the latest changes is essential to maintaining or improving your rankings. In 2024, factors like user experience (UX), mobile optimization, and content relevance are more critical than ever. Google now prioritizes websites that provide a seamless and enjoyable experience for users across all devices. This means ensuring your site is fast, mobile-friendly, and secure, while also delivering valuable, relevant content. Staying ahead of Google’s algorithm updates requires a proactive approach. Monitoring your site’s performance, keeping track of industry trends, and adapting your strategies in response to algorithm changes are all crucial to maintaining your ranking. Conclusion: SEO in 2024 is About Sustainable Growth SEO in 2024 is all about sustainable, long-term growth. Quick fixes and shortcuts may deliver temporary results, but they often come with the risk of penalties and long-term damage to your website’s credibility. Instead, focus on implementing ethical SEO practices that prioritize user experience, quality content, and technical optimization. By investing in a comprehensive SEO strategy that adapts to the latest trends—such as AI, voice search, and local SEO—you can ensure that your website ranks better, drives more traffic, and delivers lasting results.

				<![CDATA[<p>10 Vital SEO Steps for Every New Website in 2024 Launching a new website is exciting, but ensuring that it ranks well in search engines requires a solid SEO strategy. The constantly changing algorithms and the complexities of SEO can be intimidating, especially for a new site. As an expert in digital marketing and SEO, Jetquins Travels is here to guide you through the essential steps that will help your new website rank better and faster in 2024. Here are the 10 vital SEO steps for every new website in 2024: 1. Choose a Relevant Domain Name Your domain name is your online identity, so it&#8217;s crucial to pick a name that&#8217;s closely related to your product or service. A domain name that includes a relevant keyword can make it easier to rank in search results, especially if it’s directly connected to your niche. In addition, your domain should be short, easy to spell, and memorable. A catchy and industry-specific domain name can help with branding and recognition, making it more likely to gain popularity quickly. 2. Perform Accurate Keyword Research Keyword research is the foundation of a successful SEO strategy. Before creating content, it&#8217;s essential to identify the terms and phrases your target audience is searching for. These keywords should be directly related to your product or service. Tools like Google Keyword Planner, Ahrefs, and SEMrush can help you discover the right keywords. At Jetquins Travels, we use advanced tools to perform keyword research tailored to your industry, ensuring your website is optimized for search terms that drive results. 3. Create Engaging and High-Quality Content Content is still king in 2024, and producing high-quality, engaging content is key to your SEO success. Whether you’re crafting blog posts, product descriptions, or landing pages, your content should resonate with your target audience. Tailor your content to suit your audience’s interests and preferences—catchy headlines work for trendy products, while more formal language may be required for legal or professional services. Fresh, valuable, and relevant content will not only attract users but also keep them coming back to your website. 4. Build High-Quality Backlinks Backlinks are still one of the most important ranking factors in 2024. Earning backlinks from reputable websites can significantly improve your website’s authority and search engine ranking. Focus on getting links from high-quality directories, guest posts, forums, and blogs within your industry. Backlinks act as votes of confidence for your website and help search engines recognize its value. However, ensure that you are linking to and from credible sources to avoid penalties. 5. Avoid Common Linking Mistakes When building backlinks, it&#8217;s crucial to avoid common mistakes that can hurt your SEO: 6. Optimize for Page Speed and Usability Page speed and usability are critical for SEO success in 2024. A slow website can lead to high bounce rates, negatively impacting your ranking. Use tools like Google PageSpeed Insights to check your site’s loading speed and address any issues that may be slowing it down. In addition to speed, ensure that your website is user-friendly and accessible across all devices. A seamless user experience is essential for keeping visitors engaged and converting them into customers. 7. Implement On-Page SEO Best Practices On-page SEO includes optimizing individual web pages to improve their ranking on search engines. This involves optimizing your title tags, meta descriptions, headers, and image alt texts to ensure they are relevant and keyword-rich. Additionally, make sure your content is well-organized and easy to navigate, as this can improve the user experience and help search engines understand your content better. 8. Prioritize Mobile Optimization Mobile optimization is no longer optional in 2024—it’s a necessity. With the majority of searches now happening on mobile devices, Google has shifted to mobile-first indexing. This means that the mobile version of your site is the primary version that Google will index and rank. Ensure that your website is responsive, fast, and easy to use on mobile devices to provide a positive experience for mobile users and improve your rankings. 9. Leverage Local SEO If your business serves local customers, local SEO is essential. Local SEO helps your website appear in search results for users searching for services in your area. For example, when someone searches for “restaurants near me,” Google prioritizes local businesses in the search results. To optimize for local SEO, claim and optimize your Google Business Profile, encourage reviews, and ensure your website includes location-based keywords and information. 10. Stay Updated with SEO Trends and Algorithm Changes SEO is constantly evolving, and staying up to date with the latest trends and algorithm changes is critical for maintaining your ranking. Google regularly updates its algorithms to improve the quality of search results, and these changes can have a significant impact on your website’s performance. Regularly monitor industry blogs, attend webinars, and work with an SEO agency like Jetquins Travels to stay informed and adjust your strategy as needed. Conclusion: SEO Success in 2024 SEO for new websites in 2024 is all about building a solid foundation and adopting practices that drive sustainable growth. From choosing a relevant domain name to creating high-quality content and optimizing for mobile devices, these 10 steps will help your website rank better and attract more traffic.

Include as many relevant keywords most compellingly with a call-to-action that lures your customers to choose your website over your neighboring competitor. Get your site&#8217;s &#8216;Structured data&#8217; or as they call it &#8216;Schema&#8217;! If ranking higher on SERP is your scheme of things, then get Schema. A blend of your ratings, keywords, geographical tags, and images- all these play a role in improving your site&#8217;s ranking. If you incorporate all of these in a way that your users search, it surely will fetch you a winner. Schema increases your chance of appearing bypast your competitors. A simple attachment of defining your structured data can help you to rank higher and maybe even faster. URL optimization and SSL certification Often businesses tend to worry very little about the URL. Your URL is like a magician&#8217;s spell. You cannot have unnecessary characters like underscores or special characters. Keep your URL short and simple to ensure it focuses on ranking and nothing else. SSL encryption is the mighty sword that safeguards your website and simultaneously wins the trust of your search engine. Especially if your business is in the e-commerce domain, you must invest in SSL encryption to safeguard all your details like credit card information and user details. Build a trustworthy bond and not just links! Higher domain linking websites indeed rank better always. By building credible links that appear on other similar websites can take you a long way.

<p>Do you find it a struggle to rank higher on google? Have you felt it to be useless on the 8th sheet of the google result page? Can your website ever befriend Google to make it rank better?</p>



<p>If you are thinking in these lines, we at <a href="https://www.jetquins travelsagency.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jetquins Travels</a> have a solution for you, and it is none other than practicing SEO techniques!</p>



<p><span id="more-376"></span><br>Search Engine Optimization(SEO) is all about presenting the user with his relevant searches. The &#8220;relevant search&#8221; is a concept in itself. Some algorithms define based on the keywords, actual query the users look for, etc. Based on these, the most relevant pages that are optimized pages will rank on the search engine results page.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Follow these fundamental SEO guidelines to rank better across search engines!</strong></h3>



<ul>
<li>Title Tags and Meta Tags -the On-page SEO essentials!</li>
<p>When your site shows up on a search result, the words used are displayed to your users. It is only wise to make sure your title tags are less than 55characters, and Meta tags are less than 160 characters. Include as many relevant keywords most compellingly with a call-to-action that lures your customers to choose your website over your neighboring competitor.</p>
<li>Get your site&#8217;s &#8216;Structured data&#8217; or as they call it &#8216;Schema&#8217;!</li>
<p>If ranking higher on SERP is your scheme of things, then get Schema. A blend of your ratings, keywords, geographical tags, and images- all these play a role in improving your site&#8217;s ranking. If you incorporate all of these in a way that your users search, it surely will fetch you a winner. Schema increases your chance of appearing bypast your competitors. A simple attachment of defining your structured data can help you to rank higher and maybe even faster.</p>
<li>URL optimization and SSL certification</li>
<p>Often businesses tend to worry very little about the URL. Your URL is like a magician&#8217;s spell. You cannot have unnecessary characters like underscores or special characters. Keep your URL short and simple to ensure it focuses on ranking and nothing else. 
SSL encryption is the mighty sword that safeguards your website and simultaneously wins the trust of your search engine. Especially if your business is in the e-commerce domain, you must invest in SSL encryption to safeguard all your details like credit card information and user details.</p>
<li>Build a trustworthy bond and not just links!</li>
<p>Higher domain linking websites indeed rank better always. By building credible links that appear on other similar websites can take you a long way. A bond that is trusted by local businesses and brand influencers and endorsements by local listings can give plenty of backlinks to your website.</p>
</ul>

				<![CDATA[<p>How can I get SEO for my website faster than my competitors? By when can I reap the benefits of SEO? Why can&#8217;t my website start to rank on the first page of the SERP page? If you are pondering over these thoughts, then let us remind you, &#8220;there is no shortcut to success&#8221;Over several years of search engine&#8217;s existence, SEO has found its unique place in optimizing brands across online platforms. However, SEO does not come as an instant recipe, it is a long term investment that bears bigger fruits when practiced efficiently in the long term. It is an organic way of inviting your target audience and pleasing the search engines including the use of the right keywords and relevant links. Why do we need SEO for any business? If you want to promote your online business, in the best organic way, then SEO is the best tool to boost your business. Boosting categories of your product on your website, especially if you are creating a niche, then SEO can do a great deal of good by bringing your target customers to you! A unique blend of content marketing and Search Engine Optimization techniques happens due to the latent semantic index or LSI. This unique concoction of SEO+content can befriend the search engines and ensure better SERP results. Understanding SEO: Many businesses set the goals to rank #1 in an organic way(via a natural listing on SERP) on Google or Bing to seem prudent to their customers. However, if you manage to rank, it becomes important to recognize that ranking may not necessarily mean conversions. Eventually, there may be higher web traffic and click-through rate(CTR) but if your on-page optimization is not executed well for conversions then it may not result well for your business. To encourage conversions is as essential as keyword research and thus SEO must be followed religiously on a concurrent basis. Essential ranking secrets! Do not forget that &#8220;Content is King&#8221; Again the LSI &#8211; latent semantics are key- so make sure your content has it all conveyed. Longer content that is informative and original only ranks well. Fresh content: Current events and Industry updated content are very important- the google freshness algorithm monitors the changes in the industry and only the freshest concepts bag the first prize! User Experience An easily navigatable website that is aesthetic creates a higher dwell time on your website. Design, sitemaps, proper functionality to encourage conversions &#8211; all in all, the UX is vital for any web visitor to become a client. Conclusion: Effective strategies need effort! and SEO is an on-going investment that nurtures your company&#8217;s online organic growth!

				<![CDATA[<p>Have you ever wondered if old and proven methods are better over new and innovative ideas? Well, when it comes to digital marketing upgrades, we all know old becomes obsolete. But let us take a look at these factors that make a difference in the SEO world. Keywords in SEO: The foundation of any well-executed SEO strategy has to do with Keyword research. Earlier, the use of raw keywords or shorter keywords was more popular i.e., only on the product or services. For example, &#8220;marketing&#8221;, &#8220;online&#8221;, or a maximum it would be &#8220;online marketing&#8221;. Today the longer keywords are better ranked and appreciated by search engines. For example, &#8220;online marketing in Patna&#8221;, &#8220;digital marketing in Patna&#8221; The difference has been keyword research focuses on keyword targeting. The new keywords research is conducted with the intention to draw clicks to the website. Keyword variants: For capitalizing on all the keywords relating to the product or service, websites had separate pages to attract all the search engines and users. This was very popular until the last 4-5 years back where the usability of the website was compromised and bulky websites were acceptable. With the advent of mobile users ruling the search engines, it has become a smarter option to use a lighter website that incorporates as many keywords and keyword variants in its content. Parallelly with the help of Hummingbird and RankBrain upgrades, the search engines started understanding the content which in turn helped these lighter and user-friendly websites to rank better. Digital marketing trends have adopted these strategies. Anchor texts: In the olden days, multiple links would mean a great deal of trust-faction, be it for the users or search engines. A wide range of internal and external links was put on websites making them highly valued. Today search engines find it spammy to have too many anchor links on a single page. The suggested best practice is to have fewer links and further links may be added at the footer of the page. Domain names: In the earlier days, it was considered good to have richer or longer domain names like &#8220;www.onlinedigitalmarketing.com&#8221;. It was thought to be easier to optimize if the domain had most of the keywords. To an extent it is true. However, over the years, content optimization and content marketing have taken over making domains to be more meaningful and short. They have also created a &#8220;credibility&#8221; factor that makes content-driven strategies more useful in the current era.</p>
