        "rendered": "<p>Hey, I just heard some absolutely horrible SEO advice. Full story: So last night I went out to dinner with a friend of mine. This friend runs a startup in Berlin that just got funding&#8230;which means that he needs to grow FAST. After we order our food, he turns to me and says: &#8220;I met with an SEO agency this week. And they had some interesting ideas. They recommended that we create 150 blog posts, each one optimized around a long tail keyword. What do you think?&#8221; My response: &#8220;Dude, honestly, that&#8217;s the worst approach to SEO I&#8217;ve ever heard in my life.&#8221; I then went on to explain why the &#8220;publish a bunch of mediocre content optimized around long tail keywords&#8221; approach doesn&#8217;t work anymore. To prove my point, I shared how I quickly grew Backlinko by emphasizing content QUALITY over quantity: &#8220;Believe it or not, but you don&#8217;t need lots of content. In fact, when Backlinko had 9 posts I was already on the first page for competitive keywords, like &#8220;on page SEO&#8221; and &#8220;backlinks&#8221;. Today, my blog has 37 total posts, which is significantly less than most blogs. As long as you create content that Google wants to see, you&#8217;ll rank for competitive keywords.&#8221; The question is: HOW do you create content that Google wants to see? Fortunately, you don&#8217;t need to guess. As it turns out, Google hires hundreds of &#8220;Quality Raters&#8221; to help evaluate their search results. And Google hands every rater a thick &#8220;Quality Guidelines&#8221; document. This document outlines EXACTLY what Google considers &#8220;great content.&#8221;. Google updated the guidelines last month &nbsp;It&#8217;s a whopping 157 pages. And to save you some time, I&#8217;ll show you the 3 most important takeaways from this document. Takeaway #1: Google Loves &#8220;Comprehensive&#8221; Content Google wants to rank content that FULLY answers a searcher&#8217;s question. That&#8217;s why the guidelines document states: &#8220;An&nbsp;unsatisfying&nbsp;amount&nbsp;of&nbsp;main content is&nbsp;a&nbsp;sufficient&nbsp;reason&nbsp;to&nbsp;give&nbsp;a&nbsp;page&nbsp;a&nbsp;Low Quality rating.&#8221; This guideline is in-line with my recent ranking factors study (we found that publishing comprehensive, in depth content can help you rank higher in Google). So: how do you create comprehensive content? Create long, in-depth content that covers 100% of your topic. For example, this guide to video SEO weighs in at a whopping 4,234 words. Which makes it (by far) the most comprehensive piece of content about video SEO on the internet. Takeaway #2: Google Doesn&#8217;t Like &#8220;Keyword Stuffing&#8221; No surprise there. But what might surprise you is Google puts keyword-stuffed content in the same category as content created with: &#8220;little to no time, effort, expertise, manual curation, or added value for the user.&#8221; Ouch. In other words, in the eyes of Google, keyword stuffing can destroy an otherwise awesome piece of content. Fortunately, you can help Google understand what your page is about&#8230;without keyword stuffing. In fact, I recommend a nuanced approach. Here&#8217;s a guide that outlines 9 of my favorite (white hat) on-page SEO strategies. Takeaway #3: Google Is Fed Up With Clickbait Google calls clickbait &#8220;exaggerated titles&#8221;. They state that these titles: &#8220;can result in a very poor user experience when users click a link only to find that the page does not match their expectations.&#8221; I agree. Clickbait can work in the short-term. But it almost always backfires when users realize they&#8217;ve been tricked. The funny thing is: you don&#8217;t even need clickbait titles to get lots of clicks. Instead, I recommend using &#8220;The CTR Magnet Method&#8221;. You can learn exactly how this strategy works in this video. Now these 3 takeaways are interesting&#8230; But to me, what Google DOESN&#8217;T mention is just as interesting. Note how the guidelines don&#8217;t say anything about &#8220;see if the site has at least X pages&#8221; Or &#8220;make sure the site is regularly updated&#8221;. That&#8217;s because those things don&#8217;t matter. Instead of pumping out lots of content, I recommend focusing on the 3 guidelines I just shared with you.<\/p>\n",
