This technology enables the storage of information in blocks rather than conventionally. Once the blocks are assembled then they are joined to make a chain. Blockchain systems come with immense benefits for the users, one of which is that it makes transactions more secure and error-free.\n<br>Digital currency like bitcoin is underpinned by this technology, also cryptocurrency usage has increased drastically in the past few years because major payment methods agreed to accept Bitcoin. As per 2019 reports, more than 34 million blockchain wallets were used across the globe.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some major benefits that Blockchain Technology offers for website development are: &#8211; It allows data to be transferred across the network without the requirement for mediators.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8211; With the use of blockchain, data can be stored on a network enabling users to fill in details easily.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8211; This system is decentralised so it is less prone to mistakes.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8211; It operates on consensus algorithms which makes it almost impossible to crack into.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-medium-font-size\"><strong><strong>2- Progressive web applications<\/strong><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This innovation by top developers is among the top trends in web development. Known as PWA is an application that functions as a website with an almost full native mobile app experience. A customer interacts with this as a native application that runs independently on the browser. \n<br>There are many efficiencies that are brought into website development with the use of this application. Some of them are Reduced development and support costs; a Quicker launch to the market; Easier distribution; Saving device power and storage; High speed; Offline usage; Better engagement and conversion; Seamless maintenance and updating.\n<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As per Ericsson\u2019s research, global mobile data traffic is projected to become 4.5x larger and is expected to reach a monthly amount of 226 EB in 2026. This defines that now the audience can use mobile devices also for website exploring purposes. This technology is new and would take some time to be used by an extensive audience but this has proved to be very useful for businesses to stay competitive in the modern digital market. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"text-transform: underline; has-medium-font-size\"><strong><strong><strong><strong>3- Augmented reality (WebAR)<\/strong><\/strong><\/strong><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The technology that has broken all limitations of Digital solutions is becoming popular day by day. Augmented reality is an astonishing technology designed for mobile devices, education &amp; health care sectors and for gaming.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many top e-commerce brands are showing enthusiasm to apply this technology to their websites. Especially, a brand like Amazon has deployed AR technology in its website to allow customers to check how the furniture fits in their space. Other brands like Sephora, IKEA, and MOSCOT are also making optimum use of this technology.

The loading time of AMP pages is about 2 seconds whereas non-AMP pages usually take up to 22 seconds. \n<br>There are many benefits that an entrepreneur can get if AMP pages are used for the website such as Easy optimization for search engines, Adjusts to any browser, No need to create sitemaps to be identified by search engines and Low bounce rates.\n\n<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With the increasing usage of the internet and digital platforms, the AMP is a solution for developers that they welcome the most. Also, AMP deployment eliminates the cost of UX and customers can be attracted even with low internet speed. This innovation was made for motivating small entrepreneurs to create their own websites that can be manoeuvred smoothly on all mobile devices.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-medium-font-size\"><strong><strong><strong>5- Artificial intelligence (AI) and bots<\/strong><\/strong><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>AI technology helps digital platforms to comprehend and collect data, and resolve crucial matters. Its impact on web development has given rise to innovative and amazing concepts that attract users incredibly. \n<br>Basically, an AI chatbot is up-gradation to technology that enables brands to reach out and interact with the audience in a more personalized way.

As chatbots are integrated with messenger it helps to develop several applications, also provides an incredible user experience. \n<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-medium-font-size\"><strong><strong><strong>6- Voice Search Optimization<\/strong><\/strong><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This technology has been introduced to make searching pages on Google easy and convenient by optimising Voice search. \n<br>Voice assistants and loT technology optimised in a website help its pages to rank higher because the devices are becoming more common that has a voice search option in them.\n<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Voice search optimization is becoming more popular day by day and developers are using this technology to optimum and are looking forward to providing the audience with a personalised AI-based experience.

API technology has been in use for 20 years. Earlier developers used to focus on product development first, and later because of the need to establish a connection with software and devices this technology came as a rescue.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apart from being convenient for web developers, API-first development comes with plenty of perks for other purposes also, such as:&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>-Lowering the learning curve of developers as well-documented and consistent APIs are provided,&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>-Allows Stakeholders to provide feedback on the design of an API before any code is written,&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>-Because APIs are reliable and consistent it reduces the risk of system failure.<\/p>\n",
