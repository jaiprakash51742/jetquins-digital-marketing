The end document looks completely new but it is not the case actually. It does not originate with your content ideas so it is considered a duplicate.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<!--more-->\n\n\n\n<p>When you are doing <strong>Content Repurposing <\/strong>you are recycling existing content or some elements of the content. The purpose here is to reach new audiences via new platforms with the same article. The end document is the same as the previous one but envisioned for a completely new purpose and in a new format.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>From here onwards we will discuss the definition of both the concepts separately and know which one is more prominent in the Digital world.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\"><strong>UNDERSTANDING CONTENT SPINNING<\/strong><strong>&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Content Spinning<\/strong> is a method of writing for SEO and other digital marketing platforms. It is a way of creating new content without actually creating new content, done by making changes in the existing article and replacing the words. It\u2019s a technique of giving the false impression that you have written this whole thing as new.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As mentioned above, when you are doing <strong>Content Spinning <\/strong>you are changing the phrases, sentences, entire paragraphs or replacing major words with synonyms of the existing article. The end document looks completely new but it is not the case actually. It does not originate with your content ideas so it is considered a duplicate.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For performing content spinning there are tools available but you can do it manually as well. The biggest drawback here is that the tools used are more likely to give a vague final copy because these tools only switch the words with synonyms and rephrase the sentences without considering the actual intent of those words and the sentence.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Spinning the content is usually not recommended by Digital experts but for those who still want to use content spinning, they can use the best-paid tools such as the Best Spinner, Chimp Rewriter, SpinBot, WordAI and SpinnerChief. These tools can be used to maintain the authenticity of the article and are still capable of replacing a text, switching the words around, and altering the whole layout of the content.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because these tools are usually accessed after subscription the quality they provide is also premium, they can spin your content to another level of profundity.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\"><strong>How Content Spinning Can Be Helpful<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For <a href=\"https:\/\/www.jetquins travelsagency.com\/\">digital marketing<\/a> campaigns and most significantly for SEO, the spinning of the content is preferred by the writers because of the fact that the high ranking quality content and well-written content about a particular niche is required for generating traffic and for ranking at top of Google\u2019s SERP.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Taking ideas from others\u2019 articles and spinning them into your style fulfils the above requirement of campaigns.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The spinning in this way is effective and can serve as influential as new content if it is formed in different versions including high-ranking words and a well-framed structure.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Content Spinning is still considered useful for <a href=\"https:\/\/www.jetquins travelsagency.com\/seo-company-patna.html\">SEO<\/a> purposes because the spun content is effective in ranking at SERP and Google algorithms look for an original piece of content, check the quality and backlinks of the content.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But there are chances that Google crawlers might notice the oddity in your spun content and mark it as black-hat. So if you want to accomplish your marketing goals via content spinning you must be very cautious and focused on the authenticity of the content.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Applying Content Spinning to Existing Content<\/strong><strong>&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There can be plenty of content that you can pick from your or others\u2019 published work and try to spin it but not all content is going to be effective. So it is important to analyse which content applying content spinning can give the finest result. Usually, content spinning is applied by changing the words, rephrasing the sentences, adding more new words, as the replacement fits in the existing context.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When you are trying to modify the content you must keep in mind that your final copy must look totally different from the original content, so when Google crawlers check the authenticity of your spun content then the overall structure must be deemed different and fresh content.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Spinning content is not considered a good thing for your business image but if all the above protocols of content spinning are followed properly then you can get rid of the risk of getting your business image damaged.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\"><strong>UNDERSTANDING CONTENT REPURPOSING<\/strong><strong>&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This concept is gaining great importance in the Digital world at high momentum. The content creators are approached more for repurposing content as it enables the old tale to shine again.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Recycling the existing article for a different purpose for a different set of audiences makes this option more preferable when compared to spinning content.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As mentioned above, when you are doing <strong>Content Repurposing <\/strong>you are recycling an existing article or some elements of the article. The purpose here is to reach new audiences via new platforms with the same article. The end document is the same as the previous one but envisioned for a completely new purpose and in a new format.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can repurpose the written articles, posts, videos and even graphics. The matter of work which you have already used in any other platform or way you can use it on another platform in some other way.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is very effective in saving time and energy yet giving favourable results if repurposed properly.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, if you have published a post with a graphic on Instagram you can repurpose the graphic image for other marketing campaigns. If you have published a video then you can turn it into a podcast. You can use the script of the video for your website page. These are some common ways of repurposing your content, and one thing to keep in mind is that you should be the owner of the content you are going to use for repurposing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>How Content Repurposing Can Be Helpful<\/strong><strong>&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You invest a lot of time and energy in creating content worth watching or reading. Using that content one time for limited eyes sounds quite unfair. Content repurposing allows you to reuse your best work again and bring it in front of new eyes. There are many benefits that you can get as a marketeer when you repurpose the previous content with a new aim and vision.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>More Reach To Target Audiences<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Content that you posted or uploaded before might have reached the limited audience of that particular platform. If you want to expand the audience for your content then reusing the same content in a different style on another platform can fulfil your purpose.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The old content that you published might not be able to meet your expectations in terms of traffic generation so you can try to get those results again from different mediums, this time the perspective of the target audience can also be different due to the changed circumstances.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also, content repurposing covers different portions of the audience, meaning some prefer exploring particular content through video and some prefer reading an article. So publishing single content through different platforms covers all choices of people.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Reminder For Audience On Important Aspects<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>People tend to explore some content and forget it later. When they are in need of your services they don\u2019t think about your campaign that was published before and have no idea how your services can be helpful for them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you revive the old post again and bring it insight of your audience in a different style then there are possibilities to get leads that were skipped earlier. If there are some services that you want to promote the most, getting it done through Content repurposing can be an efficient way of marketing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\"><strong>Applying Content Repurposing to Existing Content<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When you are going to repurpose the content for your new campaign then you must consider some important aspects before choosing which content you must use for content repurposing. While brainstorming the previous content you should look for a piece of content that received the highest reach, popularity and delivered favourable consequences. Consider the type of content you are going to create and analyse if it met your expectations when it was published before.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Among the list of published content examine the current newsworthiness of the topic. Choosing content that is currently trending most is the best content to repurpose. If the same content didn\u2019t gain popularity previously doesn\u2019t mean it can not gain popularity now. The marketing stats and trends keep changing so the type of content you are going to repurpose must have its importance today.<\/p>\n",
